  <h2>Troubleshooting common errors</h2>

  <p>
    Several Herbie error messages refer to this page for additional
    information and debugging tips.
  </p>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">“Invalid syntax” error</h3>

  <p>
    This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
    include misspelling function names and parenthesizing expressions
    that must not be parenthesized. For example, in
    <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, <code>(x)</code> is incorrect:
    <code>x</code> is a variable so isn't parenthesized. <code>(- (exp
    x) 1)</code> would be the correct way of writing that expression.
    Please review the <a href="input.html">input format</a>
    documentation for more.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">“Cannot sample enough valid points” error</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie uses random sampling to select the points which it will use
    to evaluate the error of an expression. This error occurs when it
    is not able to find enough valid points. For example, consider the
    expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>. This expression yields
    a valid result only when <code>x</code> is between -1001 and -999,
    a rather narrow range.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution is to help out Herbie by specifying a precondition.
    Specify <code>:pre (&lt; -1001 x -999)</code> for the example
    above. Herbie will use the precondition to improve its sampling
    strategy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">“No valid values” error</h3>

  <p>
    This error indicates that your precondition excludes all possible
    inputs. For example, the precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code>
    excludes all inputs. Herbie raises this exception only when it can
    determine that no inputs work. The solution is to fix the
    precondition to allow some inputs. Note that sufficiently complex
    unsatisfiable preconditions instead raise the error above.
  </p>

  <h3 id="mpfr-prec-limit">“Exceeded MPFR precision limit” error</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie computes "ground truth" results using
    <a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a>. For some expressions,
    like <code>(sin (exp x))</code>, using MPFR in this way requires
    exponentially many bits to compute a correct result. Instead of
    simply timing out in such cases, Herbie limits the MPFR precision
    to 10,000 bits and raises this error when it hits that limit.
  </p>

  <h3>Missing reports chart on Chrome</h3>

  <p>
    When using Chrome to view web pages on your local machine, Chrome
    disables certain APIs for security reasons; this prevents the
    Herbie reports from drawing the chart. Run Chrome
    with <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> to fix this error.
  </p>

  <h3 id="native-ops">"Warning: native <i>operation</i> not supported on your system"</h3>

  <p>
    Some systems may not support a native implementation for all
    operations that Herbie uses. Herbie provides a default fallback
    implementation which is used by default for functions whose
    native implementation is not found. You can disable this fallback
    functionality with <code>--disable precision:fallback</code>.
