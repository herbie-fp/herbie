    <h1>Installing Herbie</h1>
  </header>
  
  <p>
    Herbie currently supports Linux, OS X, and
    Windows<sup title="Supported in beta since Herbie 1.2.">β</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> can be installed from a package or
    from source. (It is also available in
    a <a href="docker.html">Docker</a> image.) To install Herbie, first install
    <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, which Herbie is
    written in.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Racket</h2>

  <p>
    Use the <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v6.12.html">official
    installer</a> to install Racket, or use distro-provided packages
    provided they are version 6.7 or later of Racket (earlier versions
    are not supported).
  </p>

  <p>
    Test that Racket is installed correctly and has a correct version:
  </p>

  <pre><strong>$</strong> racket
Welcome to Racket v6.12.
> (exit)</pre>
  
  <h2>Installing Herbie from a package</h2>

  <p>Once Racket is installed, install Herbie with:</p>

  <pre>raco pkg install herbie</pre>

  <p>
    This will install Herbie, compile it for faster startup, and place
    an executable in your Racket user path, likely
    into <code>~/.racket/6.12/</code>. If you add this directory to
    your <code>PATH</code> you will be able to run herbie with
    the <code>herbie</code> command.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Herbie from source</h2>

  <p>
    Once Racket is installed, download the Herbie source
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie">from GitHub</a> with:
  </p>

  <pre>git clone https://github.com/uwplse/herbie</pre>

  <p>
    If you go to the <code>herbie</code> directory,
    you should see a <code>README.md</code> file, a directory named <code>src</code>,
    a directory named <code>bench/</code>, and a few other directories.
    Do a trial run of Herbie to make sure everything is installed and working correctly:
  </p>

  <pre>racket src/herbie.rkt report bench/tutorial.rkt graphs/</pre>

  <p>
    This command will take approximately a minute to run.
    After the command completes,
      a directory named <code>graphs</code> should be created.
    Open the <code>report.html</code> file inside with your browser;
      you will see a listing of the expressions Herbie was run on,
      all of which should be green.
    If not, please check that your Racket installation is at least version 6.7,
      and if the error still persists,
      please <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie/issues">submit a bug</a>.
  </p>

  <p>You can make Herbie start up faster by byte-compiling it:</p>

  <pre>raco make src/herbie.rkt</pre>

  <p>
    Once Herbie is installed and working correctly,
    check out the <a href="doc/1.0/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Herbie from Docker</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> is a container manager,
    which is sort of like an easily-scriptable virtual machine. We do
    not recommend using Herbie through Docker without prior Docker
    experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/">install
    Docker</a>. Docker supports Windows, OS X, and Linux. Depending on
    how you install Docker, you may need to prefix
    all <code>docker</code> commands on this page
    with <code>sudo</code> or run them as the root or administrative
    user.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Docker installed, you should be able to download the Herbie image with:
  </p>
 
  <pre>docker pull uwplse/herbie</pre>
  
  <p>
    Check out the <a href="docker.html">Docker page</a> for more on
    how to run Herbie with Docker.
