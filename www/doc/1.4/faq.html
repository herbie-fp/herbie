  <p><a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically transforms floating
  point expressions into more accurate forms. This page troubleshoots
  common Herbie errors.</p>


  <h2>Common errors</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie error messages refer here for additional information and
    debugging tips.
  </p>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">Invalid syntax</h3>

  <p>
    This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
    include misspelled function names and parenthesized expressions
    that should not be parenthesized. For example, in
    <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, the expression <code>x</code> is a
    variable so shouldn't be parenthesized. <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code>
    would be the correct way of writing that expression. Please review
    the <a href="input.html">input format</a> documentation for more.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid points</h3>

  <p>This error occurs when Herbie is unable to find enough valid
  points. For example, the expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>
  only yields a valid result when <code>x</code> is between -1001 and
  -999, a rather narrow range. The solution is to help out Herbie by
  specifying a precondition: <code>:pre (&lt; -1001 x -999)</code>.
  Herbie will use the precondition to improve its sampling strategy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">No valid values</h3>

  <p>This error indicates that your precondition excludes all possible
  inputs. For example, the precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code>
  excludes all inputs. Herbie raises this exception when it can prove
  that no inputs could work. The solution is to fix the precondition
  to allow some inputs.</p>

  <h3 id="mpfr-prec-limit">Exceeded MPFR precision limit</h3>

  <p>This rare error indicates that Herbie could not compute a "ground
  truth" for your expression. For some expressions, like <code>(sin
  (exp x))</code>, calculating a correct output for large input values
  requires exponentially many bits. Herbie raises this error when more
  than 10,000 bits are required.</p>


  <h2>Common warnings</h2>

  <p>Herbie warnings refer here for explanations and common actions to
  take.</p>

  <h3 id="ground-truth">Could not determine a ground truth</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when some inputs require more than
    10 000 bits to compute an exact ground truth value. For example,
    to compute <code>(/ (exp x) (exp x))</code> for very
    large <code>x</code>, absurdly large exponents would be required.
    Herbie discards such inputs and raises this warning. If you see
    this warning, you should add a restrictive precondition, such
    as <code>:pre (&lt; -100 x 100)</code>, to prevent large inputs.
  </p>

  <h3 id="native-ops">Native <var>operation</var> not supported on your system</h3>

  <p>
    Some systems do not have native implementations for all operations
    that Herbie uses. (For example, Microsoft's <code>math.h</code>
    does not provide the <code>y0</code> function.) Herbie provides a
    fallback implementation, but you can disable the fallback
    with <code>--disable precision:fallback</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="value-to-string">Could uniquely print <var>val</var></h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when it needs more than 10,000 bits
    to produce a string representation for a given value. This is
    likely the result of a bug in a third-party plugin.
  </p>

  <h3 id="egg-herbie">Falling back on racket egraph because egg-herbie package not installed</h3>

  <p>
    The package <code>egg-herbie</code> provides the "equivalence
    graph" data structure for simplifying expressions. If it is not
    installed, Herbie will fall back on an implementation written in
    Racket. Herbie will get similar results but run roughly twice as
    long. <code>egg-herbie</code> is packaged for Windows, macOS, and
    Linux, and is installed automatically by <code>raco</code>.

  <h2>Known bugs</h2>

  <p>Bugs that cannot be directly fixed are documented in this section.</p>

  <h3>Missing reports chart on Chrome</h3>

  <p>
    When using Chrome to view web pages on your local machine, Chrome
    disables certain APIs for security reasons; this prevents the
    Herbie reports from drawing the
    chart. <a href="http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/">Run
    Chrome with <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code></a> to fix
    this error.
