    <h1>Herbie 1.6 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 1.6! This release focuses on further integration of egg, improved reliability,
  and a better web interface. Our favorite features are below.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.</p>

  <p><b>Join us!</b> Join the Herbie developers on the
  <a href="https://fpbench.org">FPBench</a> Slack, at the monthly
  FPBench community meetings, and at
  <a href="https://fpbench.org/talks/fptalks22.html">FPTalks 2022</a>.

  <h2>Recursive Rewriting with egg</h2>

  Two releases ago, Herbie 1.4, featured a new simplifier that used the
    <a href="https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg">egg</a> library
    which led to a substantial increase in speed.
  This release further incorporates the egg library into Herbie by replacing
    the recursive rewriter with an egg-based implementation.
  Herbie's output is now more stable across seeds compared
    to the previous implementation, maintains a similar level
    of performance, and increases accuracy gains overall.
  This change also makes it easier to add new rewrite rules, 
  since the egg-based rewriter's behavior is more predictable 
  than the old recursive rewriter was.

  <h2>Interactive Herbie</h2>

  <p>
  Despite the fact that most users interact with Herbie via the demo page,
    the web interface has historically had a minimal design.
  As part of a ongoing push to make Herbie more user-friendly,
    new features have been added to the web interface including
    mandatory preconditions, better warnings and errors, and
    an overall cleaner design.
  We expect the demo page to change considerably in the coming year.

  <h2>Shorter Branch Conditions</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie now synthesizes branch conditions with shorter split values.
    Before, Herbie's binary search algorithm would narrow down the set of
      possible split values to a small interval from which Herbie took the midpoint.
    Often the midpoint had a long string representation which made it seem
      like it was chosen with high precision.
    Now Herbie will choose a value on that same interval with a short string representation.
    This change makes output programs more readable and highlights the
      low precision in the result of binary search.

        are loaded through plugins instead of being embedded in Herbie's core;
        a new patching subsystem bundles together the various
        rewriting methods behind a simple interface;
        recursive rewrite uses egg.

  <h2>Patching and Plugins</h2>
  
  <p>Herbie has undergone a significant architectural change since the previous release.
  Although this change may not be visible to users, we hope that it
    makes future Herbie development more streamlined and provides a clearer
    answer to the question: what is Herbie?
  In particular, two major improvements include adding the "patch table"
    and moving number system specifics out of Herbie's
    core architecture.
  </p>
  
  <p>The patch table manages most rewriting capabilities, provides a
    minimal interface to generate variants from a set of expressions,
    and caches variants in case of duplicate input expressions.
  Creating this subsystem to handle variant generation more cleanly
    separates the "generate" and "test" parts within Herbie.
  </p>
  
  <p>Herbie's double-precision and single-precision representations
    are now implemented as plugins that automatically ship
    with Herbie.
  Representation-specific operators and definitions are
    no longer present in Herbie's core architecure.
  This change makes Herbie representation-agnostic and loads
    double- and single-precision representations through the plugin interface.
  Not only is this design cleaner, but these plugins now
    serve as examples for plugin developers.
  In the future, we hope to move additional definitions
    out of core Herbie and into plugins such as error metrics
    and cost models (Pherbie).
  </p>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Precondition analysis and point sampling are unified under a single function.
      Sampling multiple functions is now supported.
    </li>
    <li>The backup sampler now just computes with MPFR floats
        at high-precision rather than the old "halfpoints" sampler.
    </li>
    <li> Constants are now represented internally as operators.
      This simplifies the plugin interface as well as Herbie's internals.
    </li>
    <li>Removes support variary operators.
      Relational operators are now expanded when parsed.</li>
    <li>Constants are always read as exact rational numbers.
      This enables additional optimizations through constant folding.
    </li>
    <li>More output languages are supported in the reports including
      Fortran, Java, Python, Julia, MatLab, and Wolfram.
    </li>
    <li>egg has been updated to 0.8.1 which has led to a performance increase.
      Make sure to have at least Rust 1.60 when installing from source.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deprecations and removals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Bessel functions <code>j0</code>, <code>j1</code>, <code>y0</code>, and <code>y1</code>
      have been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.</li>
    <li>Support for the Racket 7.x has been removed. Please upgrade.</li>
    <li>Support for complex numbers has been removed.
    Please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">let us know</a>
    if you are using it. We hope to reimplement this eventually,
    but with a better architecture.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>precision:fallback</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Use the <code>:precision racket</code> flag instead.</li>
    <li>Support for <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/regraph">regraph</a> has been removed.</li>
  </ul>
