    <h1>Herbie 1.3 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.3! This release focuses on <em>speed and
    extensibility</em>, including support for posits. Herbie 1.3 is
    nearly three times as fast as Herbie 1.2, and includes more
    detailed HTML output.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Careful performance work has made Herbie nearly three times
      faster than the 1.2 release.</li>
    <li>The "ground truth" answer for computations is now computed by
      a sound interval analysis. In rare cases, this could change
      Herbie's accuracy estimate for a program.</li>
    <li>Series expansion of <code>pow</code>s with constant exponents
      is now much faster.</li>
    <li>Complex numbers are now handled significantly more quickly.</li>
    <li>Various fixes have eliminated rare but large slowdowns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beta-quality features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports John Gustafson's
      <a href="https://posithub.org/">posit</a> format for systems
      supported by
      the <a href="https://gitlab.com/cerlane/SoftPosit">SoftPosit</a>
      library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie has a <a href="../../index.html">new website</a>!
      Hopefully it's a little easier to learn about what Herbie is and
      how to use it.</li>
    <li>Herbie now produces somewhat simpler output, for example by
      simplifying, exact constant expressions like <code>(+ 2
      2)</code>.</li>
    <li>Herbie now shows preconditions in its HTML output.</li>
    <li>Herbie will now show warnings in its HTML output, including
      links to more documentation.</li>
    <li>Herbie now indents and breaks lines when it prints FPCores in
      the terminal.</li>
    <li>Herbie now uses <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a> to
      render math in the browser, which is significantly faster than
      the previous <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>
      library.</li>
    <li>Error and timeout pages now show the input program.</li>
    <li>You can now middle-click on the report page arrows to open in
      new tab.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reports now link to an extensive collection of quality and
      performance metrics. This should help improve Herbie's speed and
      accuracy over time.</li>
    <li>Many bugs in single-precision mode have been fixed, including
      in both the core algorithm and in output and plotting.</li>
    <li>The new <kbd>reproduce</kbd> command allows rerunning a
      report.</li>
    <li>The timebar on the metrics page now separates regime inference
      from binary search.</li>
    <li>Herbie's JavaScript code has been refactored, making it much
      easier to maintain.</li>
    <li>Lots of old, unused code has been deleted, including a lot of
      support code for the
      obsolete <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/herbie-viz.html">Herbie
      Visualizer</a>.</li>
    <li>Glue code has been moved into a single file, clarifying
      responsibilities for a lot of modules.</li>
  </ul>
