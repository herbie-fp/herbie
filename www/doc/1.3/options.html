    <h1>Command-line Options</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../../"><code>herbie</code></a> command has several
    subcommands and allows multiple options that influence its search
    procedure and the types of solutions it finds. These options apply
    both to the report generator and the one-off command-line tool.
  </p>

  <h2>Herbie commands</h2>

  <p>Herbie can be run both interactively and in batch mode, and can
  generate output intended either for the command line or the web. We
  call these different ways of running Herbie different tools. Herbie
  provides four tools:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>herbie web</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie through your browser. <code>herbie web</code>
    starts a web server for running Herbie on your local machine, and
    directs a browser to visit that server.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie shell</code></dt>
    <dd>Starts a command-line interactive shell for using Herbie.
    Enter an <a href="input.html">FPCore expression</a> and Herbie
    will print its more-accurate version.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie improve input output</code></dt>
    <dd>Runs Herbie on the expressions in the <code>input</code> file
    or directory, and outputs the result to <code>output</code>, which
    will be a single file of FPCore outputs.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie report input output</code></dt>
    <dd>Runs Herbie on the expressions in the <code>input</code> file
    or directory, and produces a directory of HTML web pages that
    describe Herbie's output, how it derived that output, and
    additional charts and information about the improvement process.
    These pages can be viewed in any browser (though with
    a <a href="faq.html">quirk</a> for Chrome).</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>We recommend using the web tools, <code>web</code>
  and <code>report</code>, since HTML allows Herbie to give you more
  information about how and why it improved a floating-point
  expression's accuracy. Particularly useful are the graphs it
  produces of error versus input, which can help you understand
  whether Herbie's improvements matter for your user cases.</p>

  <p>For any tool, you can run <code>herbie <var>tool</var> --help</code>
    to see a listing of all available command-line options. This listing
    will include unsupported options not listed on this page.</p>

  <h2>General options</h2>

  <p>
    These options can be set on any tool. Pass them after the tool
    name but before other arguments, such as:
  </p>

  <pre><code>herbie improve --timeout 60 in.fpcore out.fpcore</code></pre>

  <p>Arguments cannot be put anywhere else.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--seed S</code></dt>
    <dd>The random seed, which changes the randomly-selected points
      that Herbie evaluates candidate expressions on. The seed is a
      number between 0 and 2<sup>31</sup> (exclusive both ends). This
      option can be used to make Herbie's results reproducible or to
      compare two different runs. Prior versions of Herbie used a
      different format for seeds, which is also still supported.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-iters N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of improvements Herbie attempts to make to the
      program. The default, 4, suffices for most programs and helps
      keep Herbie fast. If this is set very high, Herbie may run out
      of things to do and terminate before the given number of
      iterations, but in practice iterations beyond the first few
      rarely lead to lower error. This option can be increased to 5 or
      higher to check that there aren't further improvements that Herbie
      could seek out.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-points N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of randomly-selected points used to evaluate
      candidate expressions. The default, 256, gives good behavior for
      most programs. The more points sampled, the slower Herbie is.
      This option can be increased to 512 or 1024 if Herbie gives very
      inconsistent results between runs with different seeds.</dd>
    
    <dt><code>--timeout T</code></dt>
    <dd>The timeout to use per-example, in seconds. A fractional
    number of seconds can be given.</dd>

    <dt><code>--threads N</code>, for <code>improve</code> and <code>reports</code></dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-threaded operation. By default, no threads are
      used. A number can be passed to this option to use that many
      threads, or <code>yes</code> can be passed to tell Herbie to use
      all but one of the hardware threads.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Web shell options</h2>
  
  <p>The <code>web</code> tool runs Herbie as a web server, and
  connects to it from your browser. It has additional options to
  control this server.</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><code>--port N</code></dt>
    <dd>The port to run the Herbie server on. The default port is 8000.</dd>

    <dt><code>--save-session dir</code></dt>
    <dd>Save all the reports for expressions enterred into the web
    shell to this directory. The directory is also used as a
    cache of already-computed expressions.</dd>

    <dt><code>--log file</code></dt>
    <dd>Write a web access log to this file. The file is formatted
    similarly to Apache logs. If Herbie crashes for some reason, this
    log will <emph>not</emph> contain a traceback.</dd>

    <dt><code>--quiet</code></dt>
    <dd>When set, a browser is not started to point to the server main
    page, and a smaller banner is printed to the command line.</dd>

    <dt><code>--public</code></dt>
    <dd>When set, users on other computers can connect to the demo and
    use it. (In other words, the server listens
    on <code>0.0.0.0</code>.). Also useful when Herbie is run
    through <a href="docker.html">Docker</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Rulesets</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie uses a set of rewrite rules to define the changes it is
    allowed to make to formulas to improve their accuracy. These rules
    can be turned on and off in groups using <code>--disable
    rules:<var>group</var></code> and <code>--enable
    rules:<var>group</var></code>. In general, enabling more rules
    should only improve the accuracy of Herbie's output. However, if
    certain functions are not available on your platform, disabling
    the rules associated with those functions will prevent Herbie from
    using them.
  </p>

  <p>The full list of rule groups is:</p>

  <table class="function-list">
    <thead><tr><th>Rule Group</th><th>Topic of rewrite rules</th></tr></thead>
    <tr><td>arithmetic</td><td>Basic arithmetic facts</td></tr>
    <tr><td>polynomials</td><td>Factoring and powers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>fractions</td><td>Fraction arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>exponents</td><td>Exponentiation identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>trigonometry</td><td>Trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>hyperbolic</td><td>Hyperbolic trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>special</td><td>Special mathematical functions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>complex</td><td>Complex number arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>numerics</td><td>Special numerical functions <code>expm1</code>, <code>log1p</code>, <code>fma</code>, and <code>hypot</code></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>All groups except <code>numerics</code> are enabled by default,
  and we recommend turning it on if these functions are available in
  your language. If complex arithmetic or special mathematical
  functions are poorly implemented in your language, you may wish to
  disable those rule groups as well.</p>

  <h2>Search options</h2>

  <p>
    These options influence the fine properties of Herbie's search, most
    importantly the types of transformations that Herbie uses to find
    candidate programs. These options offer very fine-grained control
    over Herbie's output, and are only recommended for advanced uses of
    Herbie.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each option can be turned off with the <code>-o X</code>
    or <code>--disable X</code> command-line flag, and turned on with
    the <code>+o X</code> or <code>--enable X</code>. The defaults are
    the recommended options; turning a default-on option off typically
    results in less-accurate results, while turning a default-off
    option on typically results in more-complex and more-surprising
    output expressions.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>precision:double</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, tells Herbie to treat its input as
      double-precision calculations. If turned off, Herbie treats its
      input as a single-precision calculation.</dd>

    <dt><code>precision:fallback</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, tells Herbie to use fallback
      functions if a native implementation is not found for any
      operations. If turned off, operations with no native
      implementation will be disabled from use in the input or output.
      You will want to turn this option off if you are concerned with
      the specific behavior of libm functions.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies the expression before
      passing it to Herbie. If turned off, Herbie will not simplify
      input programs before improving them. You will want to turn off
      this option if simplifying the program will create a lot of
      error, say if the association of operations is cleverly
      chosen.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:early-exit</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, off by default, causes Herbie to exit without
      modifying the input program if it determines that the input
      program has less than 0.1 bits of error. You will want to turn
      this option on if you are running Herbie on a large corpus of
      programs that you do not believe to be inaccurate.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:rr</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's recursive rewriting
      algorithm to generate candidate programs. If turned off, Herbie
      will use a non-recursive rewriting algorithm, which will
      substantially limit the candidates Herbie finds. You will rarely
      want to turn this option off.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses series expansion to produce
      new candidates during the main improvement loop. If turned off,
      Herbie will not use series expansion in the main improvement loop.
      You will want to turn this option off if you want to avoid
      series-expansion-based rewrites, such as if you need to preserve
      the equivalence of the input and output expressions as real-number
      formulas.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies candidates during the
      main improvement loop. If turned off, candidates will not be
      simplified, which typically results in much less accurate
      expressions, since simplification is often necessary for
      cancelling terms. You will rarely want to turn this option off.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:regimes</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's regime inference
      algorithm to branch between several program candidates. If
      turned off, branches will not be inferred and the output program
      will be straight-line code (if the input was). You will want to
      turn this option off if your programming environment makes
      branches very expensive, such as in some cases of GPU
      programming.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses a final simplification pass
      after all improvements have been made. This sometimes improves
      accuracy further. If turned off, this final simplification pass
      will not be done. You will rarely want to turn this option
      off.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:avg-error</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, causes Herbie to output the
      candidate with the best average error over the chosen inputs. If
      turned off, Herbie will choose the candidate with the least
      maximum error instead. This usually produces programs with worse
      overall accuracy. You may want to turn this option off if
      worst-case accuracy is more important to you than overall
      accuracy.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:binary-search</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses binary search to refine the
      values used in <code>if</code> statement conditionals. This
      makes different runs of Herbie produce more similar results, and
      improves accuracy near those values. If turned off, binary
      search will not be used, and the branch values will be less
      accurately chosen. You will want to turn this option off if
      behavior near branches is not important to you, in which case
      turning off this option will make Herbie slightly faster.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:branch-expressions</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, allows Herbie to branch on
      expressions, not just variables. This can improve accuracy on
      regime branching, but can significantly increase the runtime,
      particularly for large programs. If turned off, Herbie will only
      try to branch on variables. You may want to turn this option off
      if Herbie runtime is more important to you than expression
      accuracy.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Upgrading from Herbie 1.0</h2>

  <p>Herbie 1.0 used
  a <a href="../1.0/using-herbie.html">different</a> command line
  syntax, without multiple tools. Translate like so:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0</code> → <code>herbie-1.1 shell</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 file</code> → <code>herbie-1.1 improve file -</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 files ...</code> → <code>cat files ... | herbie-1.1 improve - -</code><br/>
      Alternatively, collect the files into a directory and run <code>herbie-1.1 improve dir/ -</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The new syntax somewhat changes Herbie's behavior, such as by
    using the input expression as the output if Herbie times out. It
    also makes it easier to write Herbie's output to a file without
    using command-line redirection. The old syntax still works but is
    deprecated and will be removed in the next release.</p>
