    <h1>Using HerbGrind</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    <a href="../">HerbGrind</a> analyzes binaries to find inaccurate
    floating point expressions. The binaries can come from anywhere—C
    source, Fortran source, even unknown origins. This tutorial
    run HerbGrind on the built-in benchmark programs that HerbGrind ships with.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Compiling the benchmark program</h2>

  <p>
    HerbGrind ships a collection of binaries in its <code>bench/</code>
    directory. You can build them with:
  </p>
  
  <pre>make -C bench all</pre>

  <h2>Running HerbGrind</h2>

  <p>
    Let's analyze the <code>diff-roots-simple.out</code> binary that
    you compiled in the previous step. Run HerbGrind on that binary with:
  </p>

  <pre>valgrind/herbgrind-install/bin/valgrind --tool=herbgrind bench/diff-roots-simple.out</pre>

  <p>
    This should produce output that looks like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>==16725== HerbGrind, a valgrind tool for Herbie
==16725== 
==16725== Using Valgrind-3.12.0.SVN and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==16725== Command: bench/diff-roots-simple.out
==16725== 
1.578592e-07
==16725== 
Writing report out to bench/diff-roots-simple.out-errors.gh</pre>

  <p>The printed value, <code>1.578592e-07</code>, is printed by
  the <code>diff-roots-simple.org</code> binary. HerbGrind writes its
  results to the named
  file, <code>bench/diff-roots-simple.out-errors.gh</code>. This file
  contains one record for each operation; the only operation found
  in <code>diff-roots-simple.c</code> is:</p>
  
  <pre>(- (sqrt (+ 1.000000 10000000000000.000000)) (sqrt 10000000000000.000000))
subtraction in main at diff-roots-simple.c:12 (address 400A00)
43.129555 bits average error
43.129555 bits max error
Aggregated over 1 instances</pre>

  <p>
    The first line gives the expression inaccurately evaluated, and
    the second line gives its location. That line
    in <code>diff-roots-simple.c</code> is actually:
  </p>

  <pre>y = sqrt(x + 1) - sqrt(x);</pre>
  
  <p>
    Since this line of code is run only once, HerbGrind doesn't know
    that <code>x</code> is intended to be a variable, and instead
    inlines its value.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The next three lines of the output give the error incurred by the
    inaccurate computation: 43.1 bits of error over 1 instance of computing that expression.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Ignoring library calls</h2>

  <p>
    While running on <code>diff-roots-simple.out</code>, HerbGrind
    found inaccurate computations not only
    in <code>diff-roots-simple.out</code> but also in several GNU
    library calls. HerbGrind has a feature to avoid tracking floating
    point operations in libraries and other code not within your
    control by adding instrumentation to your source code.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Simply surround the numerically-interesting parts of your
    computation in the <code>HERBGRIND_BEGIN()</code>
    and <code>HERBGRIND_END()</code> macros; for
    example, <code>diff-roots-simple.c</code> does this on lines 11
    and 13. You can then run HerbGrind with
    the <code>--start-off</code> flag, which tells HerbGrind not to
    begin analyzing floating point operations until it sees
    a <code>HERBGRIND_BEGIN()</code> region:
  </p>

  <pre>valgrind/herbgrind-install/bin/valgrind --tool=herbgrind --start-off bench/diff-roots-simple.out</pre>

  <p>
    The report file now contains only the inaccurate expression
    described before, and no library computations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <code>HERBGRIND_BEGIN()</code>/<code>HERBGRIND_END()</code>
    regions can be sprinkled anywhere in your source code; it's common
    to use them to start HerbGrind only after initializing your
    program and before cleaning up and outputting results. HerbGrind
    can be turned on and off multiple times.
