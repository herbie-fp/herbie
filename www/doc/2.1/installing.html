  <p>
    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> supports Linux, macOS, and Windows 
    (though, on Windows, you will need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows">install Make</a>). It
    can be installed from a package or from source. To start, install
    <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, which Herbie is
    written in. Then install Herbie. (Herbie can also be installed
    from source or via a <a href="docker.html">Docker image</a>.)
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Racket</h2>

  <p>
    Install Racket either using
    the <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v8.10.html">official
      installer</a> or distro-provided packages. Versions as old as 8.2
    are supported, but more recent versions are faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note: on Linux, we recommend the official Racket installer
    over installing Racket via Snap. If you must install Racket from
    Snap, make sure Herbie and all packages are located in your home
    directory or another allow-listed directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Test that Racket is installed correctly and has a correct version:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">racket
Welcome to Racket v8.10 [cs].
> (exit)</pre>

  <h2>Installing Herbie from a package</h2>

  <p>
    This installation method supports Windows, macOS, and Linux for
    x86-64. It won't work for ARM computers, including recent Apple
    computers. You may also need a working version
    of <code>make</code>; on Windows, that might have to be installed
    separately.</p>

  <p>First install Racket, as above. Then install Herbie from a package with:</p>

  <pre class="shell">raco pkg install --auto herbie</pre>

  <!-- This is a copy of the text above -->

  <p>
    This command installs Herbie and its dependencies, compiles it for
    faster startup, and places the <code>herbie</code> executable in
    your Racket user path (example paths for Racket 8.10):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>On Windows, <code>AppData\Roaming\Racket\8.10\bin</code> in your user folder.</li>
    <li>On macOS, <code>Library/Racket/8.10/bin</code> in your home folder.</li>
    <li>On Linux, <code>.local/share/racket/8.10/bin</code> in your home directory.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can run <code>herbie</code> from that directory, or add it to
    your executable path. Please note that the path of the binary will
    be different on Linux if you have opted to use Snap. Once Herbie
    is installed and working correctly, check out
    the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Herbie from source</h2>
  
  <p>
    Installing Herbie from source is best if you plan to develop
    Herbie or Herbie <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a>, or if you are
    on an ARM machine.</p>

  <p>
    Install Racket.
    Then install Rust, using <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> or via some other means.
    Versions as old as 1.60.0 are supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once Racket and Rust are installed, download the Herbie source
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie">from GitHub</a> with:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">git clone https://github.com/uwplse/herbie</pre>

  <p>
    Change to the <code>herbie</code> directory;
    you should see a <code>README.md</code> file, a directory named <code>src</code>,
    a directory named <code>bench/</code>, and a few other directories.
    Install Herbie on your system with:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">make install</pre>

  <p>
    This command installs Herbie and its dependencies, compiles it for
    faster startup, and places the <code>herbie</code> executable in
    your Racket user path, just like the package installation.
    Once Herbie is installed and working correctly, check out
    the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Herbie with Docker</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> is a container manager,
    which is sort of like a virtual machine. Herbie in Docker is more
    limited; we do not recommend using Herbie through Docker without
    prior Docker experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="docker.html">Docker documentation</a> describes how
    to install and run the official <code>uwplse/herbie</code> image.
