    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> rewrites floating point expressions to
    make them more accurate. Herbie can be used
    from <a href="using-cli.html">the command-line</a> or from the
    browser; this page is about using Herbie from the browser.</p>


  <h2 id="interactive">The Herbie web shell</h2>

  <p>
    The Herbie web shell lets you interact with Herbie through your
    browser, featuring a convenient input format. The web shell is the
    friendliest and easiest way to use Herbie. Run the Herbie web
    shell with this command:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie web</pre>

  <p>After a few seconds, the web shell will rev up and direct your
  browser to Herbie:</p>
  
  <pre class="shell">herbie web
Herbie 2.0 with seed 1003430182
Find help on https://herbie.uwplse.org/, exit with Ctrl-C
Your Web application is running at http://localhost:8000/.
Stop this program at any time to terminate the Web Server.</pre>

  </figure>

  <p>You can type an input expressions in
    <a href="input.html">standard mathematical syntax</a>. After typing in an 
    expression, you will be asked to specify the range of values for each input 
    variable that Herbie should consider when trying to improve the expression. 
    Hit the "Improve with Herbie" button once you're done to run Herbie.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The web shell reports Herbie's progress and redirects to a
    <a href="report.html">report</a> once Herbie is done.
  </p>

  <p>
    The web shell can also automatically save the generated reports,
    and has <a href="options.html">many other options</a> you might
    want to explore.
  </p>


  <h2 id="batch">Batch report generation</h2>

  <p>A <a href="report.html">report</a> can also be generated directly
  from a file of input expressions in <a href="input.html">FPCore format</a>:</p>
  
  <pre class="shell">herbie report bench/tutorial.fpcore output/ 
Starting Herbie on 3 problems (seed: 770126425)...
Warning: 25.0% of points produce a very large (infinite) output. 
You may want to add a precondition.
See <a href="faq.html#inf-points">https://herbie.uwplse.org/doc/latest/faq.html#inf-points</a> for 
more.
  1/3   [   0.703s]   29→ 0     Expanding a square
  2/3   [   1.611s]    0→ 0     Commute and associate
  3/3   [   0.353s]   30→ 0     Cancel like terms</pre>

  <p>
    This command asks generates a report from the input expressions
    in <code>bench/tutorial.fpcore</code> and saves the report in the
    directory <code>output/</code>. It's best if that directory
    doesn't exist before running this command, because otherwise
    Herbie may overwrite files in that directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Occasionally you may also see Herbie emit warnings as shown above.
    All of Herbie's warnings are listed, with explanations, in
    the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once generated, open <code>output/index.html</code> in your
    favorite browser (but see <a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a> if you're
    using Chrome). That page summarizes Herbie's results for all
    expression in your input file, and you can click on individual
    expressions to see their report.
  </p>

  <p>Batch report generation is the most informative way to run Herbie
  on a large collection of inputs. Like the web shell, it can be
  customized through <a href="options.html">command-line options</a>,
  including parallelizing Herbie with multiple threads.</p>
