  <p>When used <a href="using-web.html">in the browser</a>, Herbie
    generates HTML reports full of information about the accuracy and relative 
    speed of the initial and alternative expressions.</p>

  <h2 id="links">Summary and Additional links</h2>

  <p>The top of the report page has a right-hand menu bar with
    additional links. “Metrics” give you detailed internal information
    about Herbie, while “Report”, if present, takes you back to the
    full Herbie report.</p>

  <p>Below the menu lies a brief summary of the results. Herbie can
    produce multiple alternatives to the initial program, and this
    summary gives their basic statistics.</p>

    <figcaption>Summary numbers from a Herbie report.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <dl>
    <dt>Percentage Accurate</dt>
    <dd>The <a href="errors.html">percentage accuracy</a> of the
    initial program and what Herbie thinks is its most accurate
    alternative.</dd>
    <dt>Time</dt>
    <dd>The time it took Herbie to generate all of the alternatives.</dd>
    <dt>Alternatives</dt>
    <dd>The number of alternatives found.</dd>
    <dt>Speedup</dt>
    <dd>The speed of the fastest alternative that is more accurate
    than the initial program, relative to the initial program.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="spec">Specification</h2>

  <p>Next, the specification that you gave to Herbie. This section is
    closed by default. Typically, the specification is also the
    initial program, but in some cases, like if
    the <a href="input.html"><kbd>:spec</kbd> property</a> is used,
    they can differ. The specification also includes
    any <a href="input.html#preconditions">preconditions</a> given to
    Herbie.</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="specification.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>You can use the drop-down in the top left to display the
  specification in an alternative syntax.</p>

  <p>The colored outcome bar summarizes the sampled floating-point
    inputs that produce valid, unknown, or invalid outputs. Green
    outcomes are valid, broken down into finite and infinite. Unknown
    outputs are red. Blue outcomes are invalid (fail precondition or
    domain errors) and are ignored by Herbie.</p>

  <h2 id="graph">Local Percentage Accuracy graph</h2>

  <p>
    Next, the <em>Local Percentage Accuracy</em> graph compares the
    accuracy of the initial program to Herbie's most accurate
    alternative. This is helpful for understanding the sorts of inputs
    Herbie is improving accuracy on. Sometimes, Herbie improved
    accuracy on some inputs at the cost of accuracy on other inputs
    that you care more about. You can add a
    <a href="input.html#preconditions">precondition</a> to restrict Herbie to 
    the more important inputs in that case.</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-accuracy.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>In the plot, each individual sampled point is shown with a faint
    circle, and the thick line is moving average of those individual
    samples. The red line is the initial program and the blue line is
    Herbie's most accurate alternative.</p>
  
  <p>Accuracy is shown on the vertical axis, and higher is better. The
    horizontal axis shows one of the variables in the input program;
    the dropdown in the title switches between input variables. The
    checkboxes below the graph toggle the red and blue lines on and
    off.</p>

  <p>If Herbie decided to insert an <code>if</code> statement into the
    program, the locations of those <code>if</code> statements will be
    marked with vertical bars.</p>

  <h2 id="cost-accuracy">Accuracy vs Speed</h2>
  <p>Next, a Pareto graph and table list the alternatives Herbie
    found.</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-cost-accuracy.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>Both the plot and the table show the same data. In the plot,
  accuracy is on the vertical axis and speedup is on the horizontal
  axis. Up and to the right is better. The initial program is shown
  with a red square, while each of Herbie's alternatives is shown with
  a blue circle. A faint line shows the Pareto frontier&mdash;that is,
  it goes through all Herbie alternatives that maximize speed for
  their level of accuracy. Some of Herbie's alternatives may not be on
  the Pareto frontier due to differences between the training and test
  set.</p>

  <p>In the table, each alternative is shown along with its accuracy
  and speed relative to the initial program. Values are green if they
  are better than the initial program, and black otherwise. Each
  alternative is linked to its description lower on the page.</p>

  <h2 id="alternatives">Initial program and Alternatives</h2>

  <p>Below the table come a series of boxes detailing the initial
    program and each of Herbie's alternatives, along with their
    accuracy and relative speed.</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-alternative.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>The accuracy and relative speed of each alternative is given in
    the title. Below the title, the alternative expression itself is
    given. The dropdown in the top right can be used to change the
    syntax used.</p>

  <p>By definition, the speed of the initial program is 1.0×, and it
    has no derivation since it was provided by the user.</p>

  <p>Each alternative also has a derivation, which can be shown by
    clicking on "Derivation". The derivation shows each step Herbie
    took to transform the initial program into this alternative.</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-alternative-derivation.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>Each step in the derivation gives the accuracy after that step.
    Sometimes you can use that to pick a less-complex and
    not-substantially-less-accurate program. The derivation will also
    call out any time the input is split into cases. When a part of
    the step is colored blue, that identifies the changed part of the
    expression.</p>

  <p>Derivations may also contain "step-by-step derivations"; you can
  click on those step-by-step derivations to expand them. Each step in
  the step-by-step derivation names an arithmetic law from Herbie's
  database, with <kbd>metadata-eval</kbd> meaning that Herbie used
  direct computation in a particular step.</p>

  <h2 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h2>

  <p>Finally, Herbie gives a command to reproduce that result. If you
    find a Herbie bug, include this code snippet when
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie/issues">filing an issue</a>.</p>

  <p>We expect the report to grow more informative with future
    versions. Please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">get in
      touch</a> if there is more information you'd like to see.</p>
