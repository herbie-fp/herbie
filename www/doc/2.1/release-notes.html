  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 2.1! This release focuses performance, both in the generated
  code and in the Herbie kernel itself.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.
  Visit <a href="../..">the main page</a> to learn more about Herbie.</p>
  
  <p class="warning"><b>OOPSLA, ASPLOS, and POPL Reviewers</b>, please
  do not read further, because some of the work described below is
  submitted for publication to these venues.</p>

  <h2>Faster Generated Code</h2>

         alt="A comparison of speed-accuracy curves for Herbie 2.0 and
         2.1, showing much faster low-accuracy code in Herbie 2.1.">
    <figcaption>
      Herbie 2.0 (green) and 2.1 (blue) speed-accuracy curves on the
      Hamming test suite, showing that Herbie 2.1 generates much
      faster code, especially at low accuracy levels. The impact is
      due to both typed extraction (described on the plot as
      <q>egg-serialize</q>) and the cost opportunity heuristic (described on
      the plot as <q>cost localization</q>). The orange curve shows that both
      components are necessary to achieve the best results.

  </figure>

  <p>
  Last year, <a href="../2.0/release-notes.html">Herbie 2.0</a>
  released <i>pareto mode</i>, in which Herbie generates multiple
  expressions with different speeds and accuracies. Herbie 2.1 now
  makes Herbie's generated code, especially at the
  highest-performance/lowest-accuracy level, dramatically better.
  Some features that contribute to these improvements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>With type-based extraction (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/875">#875</a>, <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/883">#883</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/887">#887</a>) Herbie
    considers performance optimizations like precision tuning at the
    same time as it considers rewrites, instead of considering each
    separately.</li>

    <li>A new cost-opportunity heuristic
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/746">#746</a>)
      allows Herbie to focus on parts of the program that can be sped up,
      generating faster low-accuracy code.</li>

    <li>Preprocessing for odd functions
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/645">#645</a>)
    generates range reductions for odd functions, which can mean more
    accurate generated code.</li>

    <li>Polynomials are now evaluated in Horner form
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/727">#727</a>).
      Together with some bug fixes
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/660">#660</a>),
    this means faster and more accurate polynomial approximations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While Herbie's generated results are much better, these changes
  alone would make Herbie more than twice as slow. This leads to the
  second category of changes.</p>

      when <code>x = 10<sup>300</sup></code> and <code>ɛ =
      10<sup>-300</sup></code>. Each row of the table represents one
      mathematical operation (or the time spent precision-tuning), and
      each pair of columns describes one iteration precision and
      execution time for that operation. Each operation's precision is
      chosen independently, so the precision column is not uniform.

  <p>
  Nearly every part of Herbie has been sped up, often significantly,
  meaning that Herbie 2.1 overall&mdash;despite the much faster
  generated code&mdash;is only 20% or so slower than Herbie 2.0.</p>

  <p>
  The most challenging improvement is a complete rewrite of Herbie's
  real evaluation system, Rival. Herbie 2.1 uses precision tuning to
  reduce the time and memory costs by approximately 40%, with the
  biggest impacts to the largest and slowest expressions. Moreover,
  Rival has
  been <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/rival/index.html">packaged</a>
  for use in other projects.
  </p>

  <p>Other optimizations to Herbie include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Regimes saw a series of improvements, including to
      data layout (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/696">#696</a>),
      sharing (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/706">#706</a>),
      types (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/748">#748</a>),
      and algorithms (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/772">#772</a>),
      which together lead to a 2–3× speed up to regimes.</li>
    <li>The floating-point program interpreter was rewritten and sped up
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/766">#766</a>).</li>
    <li>Batching sped up derivation generation significantly
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/736">#736</a>.)</li>
    <li>An accidentally-quadratic lookup in pruning was found and fixed
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/781">#781</a>).</li>
    <li>Analysis capped an exponential blow-up that occurred for some preconditions
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/762">#762</a>).</li>
    <li>Random number generation saw a small speed up
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/792">#792</a>).</li>
  </ul>
      

  <h2>New Features: Platforms and Explanations</h2>

(define-accelerator (cosd real) real
  (λ (x) (cos (* x (/ (PI) 180)))))
(define-accelerator (tand real) real
  (λ (x) (tan (* x (/ (PI) 180)))))</pre>
    <figcaption>
      A snippet from the Herbie "platform" for
      the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia language</a>,
      describing special library functions <code>cosd</code>,
      <code>sind</code>, and <code>tand</code>, which Julia provides.
      When using this platform, Herbie will use these functions in its
      generated code.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Two new features are in development and available in an
  undocumented <i>alpha</i> state in this release: platforms and explanations.</p>

  <p>Platforms allow Herbie to generate code specific
  to a given programming language, library, or hardware platform.
  Herbie can use platform-specific operators, cost models,
  and compilation styles, which leads to faster and more accurate
  code. We hope to clean up the platforms code and release it for real
  in Herbie 2.2.</p>

  <p>Explanations describe what floating-point errors Herbie found and
  what inputs they occur for. This should make Herbie easier to
  understand and a more valuable tool for learning about
  floating-point error.</p>

  <h2>Sister Projects</h2>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/odyssey">Odyssey numerics 
      workbench</a> is releasing version 1.1 today, featuring FPTaylor 
      support and expression export. Odyssey and supporting tools like 
      Herbie and FPTaylor can be installed and run locally through the 
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=herbie-fp.odyssey-fp">
      Odyssey VSCode extension</a>. New features include:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Support for using FPTaylor to compute sound error bounds in
    Odyssey. Select "FPTaylor Analysis" from the tool dropdown for an
    expression. This is a part of a larger effort to combine different
    floating point tools as parts of an analysis.</li>
    <li>Odyssey now supports exporting expressions to different
    languages using the new "Expression Export" tool.</li>
    <li>Herbie has been updated with an HTTP API endpoint to support
    Odyssey's expression export. Herbie's HTTP API endpoints are
    documented <a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org/doc/2.1/api-endpoints.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Like the Herbie demo, Odyssey now shows the percent accuracy
    of expressions, rather than bits of error.</li>
    <li>The layout of the Odyssey interface has been updated and will
    continue to see rolling updates.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/rival">Rival
    real-arithmetic package</a> is releasing version 2.0 today,
    featuring the correct-rounding code from Herbie
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/804">#804</a>),
    including the new precision tuning algorithm and a newly-build
    profiling system.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports the FPCore <code>:alt</code> field,
      including multiple alternative expressions
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/764">#764</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/783">#783</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/805">#805</a>).</li>
    <li>Many of Herbie's oldest benchmarks have gained new preconditions
      and human-written target programs
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/693">#693</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/697">#697</a>),
      which will drive Herbie development in the future.</li>
    <li>Herbie's report page has been totally rewritten, and now uses
      JavaScript. This has allowed us to sorting, filtration, and
      diffing capabilities, which has really made development easier.
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/641">#641</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/651">#651</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/687">#687</a>).
      However, this does mean that you need to run a local server to view
      report pages saved on your local disk—this is a browser security policy
      that we can't avoid. You'll see an error message explaning how
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/863">#863</a>).</li>
    <li>Friends at Intel contributed benchmarks from the DirectX specification
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/655">#656</a>).</li>
    <li>Caching has sped up Herbie's continuous integration
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/663">#663</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We now build and publish macOS Arm64 packages
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/787">#787</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/826">#862</a>).
      Thank you to Github for hosting our build infrastructure.</li>
    <li>We fixed a memory leak
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/636">#636</a>)
      and segfault
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/665">#665</a>)
      in Herbie's supporting Rust libraries. Eventually the egg folks
      tracked
      down <a href="https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg/pull/310">the
      root cause</a>, so this won't be a problem any more.</li>
    <li>Some sources of non-determinism were tracked down and fixed
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/661">#661</a>).</li>
    <li>Herbie's internals now distinguish between real and
    floating-point expressions
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/676">#676</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/702">#702</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/723">#732</a>),
    which has previously been an ad-hoc distinction.</li>
    <li>Herbie's API endpoints now use an internal job astraction
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/845">#845</a>),
    which should eventually allow them to be threaded and asynchronous.</li>
  </ul>
