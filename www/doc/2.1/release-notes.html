  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 2.1! This release focuses performance, both in the generated
  code and in the Herbie kernel itself.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.
  Visit <a href="../..">the main page</a> to learn more about Herbie.</p>
  
  <p><b>OOPSLA, ASPLOS, and POPL Reviewers</b>, please do not read
  further, because some of the work described below is submitted for
  publication to these venues.</p>

  <h2>Faster Generated Code</h2>

  <figure class="showcase side-by-side">
    <img src="localize-comparison.png"
         alt="A comparison of speed-accuracy curves for Herbie 2.0 and
         2.1, showing much faster low-accuracy code in Herbie 2.1.">
    <figcaption>
      Herbie 2.0 (green) and 2.1 (blue) speed-accuracy curves on the
      Hamming test suite, showing that Herbie 2.1 generates much
      faster code, especially at low accuracy levels. The impact is
      due to both typed extraction (described on the plot as
      egg-serialize) and the cost opportunity heuristic (described on
      the plot as cost localization). The orange curve shows that both
      components are necessary to achieve the best results.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
  Last year, <a href="../2.0/release-notes.html">Herbie 2.0</a>
  released <i>pareto mode</i>, in which Herbie generates multiple
  expressions with different speeds and accuracies. Herbie 2.1 now
  makes Herbie's generated code, especially at the highest performance
  levels, dramatically better.
  </p>

  <p>Some features that contribute to these improvements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>With type-based extraction (<a href="#">#XXX</a>) Herbie
    considers performance optimizations like precision tuning at the
    same time as it considers rewrites, instead of considering each
    separately.</li>

    <li>A new cost-opportunity heuristics
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/746">#746</a>)
      allows Herbie to focus on parts of the program that can be sped up,
      generating faster low-accuracy code.</li>

    <li>Preprocessing for odd functions
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/645">#645</a>)
    generates range reductions for odd functions, which can mean more
    accurate generated code.</li>

    <li>Polynomials are now evaluated in Horner form
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/727">#727</a>).
      Together with some bug fixes
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/660">#660</a>),
    this means faster and more accurate polynomial approximations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Faster Sampling</h2>

      when <code>x = 10<sup>300</sup></code> and <code>ɛ =
      10<sup>-300</sup></code>. Each row of the table represents one
      mathematical operation (or the time spent precision-tuning), and
      each pair of columns describes one iteration precision and
      execution time for that operation. Each operation's precision is
      chosen independently, so the precision column is not uniform.

  </figure>

  <p>
  Nearly every part of Herbie has been sped up, often significantly.
  But the most significant is clearly a complete rewrite of Herbie's
  sampling system, which uses high-precision interval arithmetic to
  determine the <i>correct</i> value for a given expression. Herbie
  2.1 now uses precision tuning to reduce the time and memory costs of
  sampling. The overall speed-up is approximately 40%, with the
  biggest impacts to the largest and slowest expressions.
  </p>

  <p>
  Herbie's new sampling code now lives in the
  the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/rival/index.html">Rival
  package</a> where it can be used by other projects. Other
  sped-up phases include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Regimes saw a series of improvements, including to
      data layout (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/696">#696</a>),
      sharing (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/706">#706</a>),
      types (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/748">#748</a>),
      and algorithms (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/772">#772</a>),
      which together lead to a 2–3× speed up to regimes.</li>
    <li>The floating-point program interpreter was rewritten and sped up
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/766">#766</a>).</li>
    <li>Batching sped up derivation generation significantly
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/736">#736</a>.)</li>
    <li>An accidentally-quadratic lookup in pruning was found and fixed
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/781">#781</a>).</li>
    <li>Analysis capped an exponential blow-up that occurred for some preconditions
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/762">#762</a>).</li>
    <li>Random number generation saw a small speed up
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/792">#792</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>So how much faster is Herbie now? Not that much actually... but
  that's because speeding up the Herbie kernel made possible the
  improvements to the generated code described above.</p>
      

  <h2>New Features: Platforms and Explanations</h2>

  <figure class="showcase">
    <pre>(define-accelerator (sind real) real
  (λ (x) (sin (* x (/ (PI) 180)))))
(define-accelerator (cosd real) real
  (λ (x) (cos (* x (/ (PI) 180)))))
(define-accelerator (tand real) real
  (λ (x) (tan (* x (/ (PI) 180)))))</pre>
    <figcaption>
      A snippet from the Herbie "platform" for
      the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia language</a>,
      describing special library functions <code>cosd</code>,
      <code>sind</code>, and <code>tand</code>, which Julia provides.
      When using this platform, Herbie will use these functions in its
      generated code.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Two new features are in development and available in an
  undocumented <i>alpha</i> state in this release: platforms and explanations.</p>

  <p>Platforms describe the specific floating-point operations
  available in on specific hardware or in a specific programming
  language or library. Herbie can then optimize a floating-point
  expression to these specific operations. This allows Herbie to
  generate faster and more accurate code. We hope to clean up the
  platforms code and release it for real in Herbie 2.2.</p>

  <p>Explanations describe what floating-point errors Herbie found and
  what inputs they occur for. This should make Herbie easier to
  understand and a more valuable tool for learning about
  floating-point error.</p>
    

  <h2>Sister Projects</h2>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/odyssey">Odyssey
    numerics workbench</a> is releasing version XXX today, featuring
    XXX.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/rival">Rival
    real-arithmetic package</a> is releasing version 2.0 today,
    featuring the correct-rounding code from Herbie
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/804">#804</a>),
    including the new precision tuning algorithm and a newly-build
    profiling system.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Improvmeents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now supports the FPCore <code>:alt</code> field,
      including multiple alternative expressions
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/764">#764</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/783">#783</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/805">#805</a>).</li>
    <li>Many of Herbie's oldest benchmarks have gained new preconditions
      and human-written target programs
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/693">#693</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/697">#697</a>),
      which will drive Herbie development in the future.</li>
    <li>Herbie's report page has been totally rewritten, and now uses
      JavaScript. This has allowed us to sorting, filtration, and
      diffing capabilities, which has really made development easier.
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/641">#641</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/651">#651</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/687">#687</a>).
      However, this does mean that you need to run a local server to view
      report pages saved on your local disk—this is a browser security policy
      that we can't avoid. You'll see an error message explaning how
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/863">#863</a>).</li>
    <li>Friends at Intel contributed benchmarks from the DirectX specification
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/655">#656</a>).</li>
    <li>Caching has sped up Herbie's continuous integration
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/663">#663</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We now build and publish macOS Arm64 packages
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/787">#787</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/826">#862</a>).
      Thank you to Github for hosting our build infrastructure.</li>
    <li>We fixed a memory leak
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/636">#636</a>)
      and segfault
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/665">#665</a>)
      in Herbie's supporting Rust libraries. Eventually the egg folks
      tracked
      down <a href="https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg/pull/310">the
      root cause</a>, so this won't be a problem any more.</li>
    <li>Some sources of non-determinism were tracked down and fixed
      (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/661">#661</a>).</li>
    <li>Herbie's internals now distinguish between real and
    floating-point expressions
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/676">#676</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/702">#702</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/723">#732</a>),
    which has previously been an ad-hoc distinction.</li>
    <li>Herbie's API endpoints now use an internal job astraction
    (<a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/pull/845">#845</a>),
    which should eventually allow them to be threaded and asynchronous.</li>
  </ul>
