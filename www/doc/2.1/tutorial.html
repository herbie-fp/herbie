    <a href="../../">Herbie</a> rewrites floating point expressions to
      make them more accurate. Floating point arithmetic is
      <a href="error.html">inaccurate</a>; even 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3 in
      floating-point. Herbie helps find and fix these mysterious
      inaccuracies.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get started, <a href="installing.html">download and install</a>
    Herbie. You're then ready to begin using it.
  </p>

  <h2>Giving Herbie expressions</h2>

  <p>Start Herbie with:</p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie web</pre>

  <p>
    After a brief wait, your web browser should open and show you
    Herbie's main window. The most important part of the page is this
    bit:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="web-input.png" alt="The program input field in the Herbie web UI."/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Let's start by just looking at an example of Herbie running.
    Click "Show an example". This will pre-fill the expression
    <kbd>sqrt(x + 1) - sqrt(x)</kbd>
    with <code>x</code> ranging from to <kbd>0</kbd> and <kbd>1.79e308</kbd>.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="range-input.png" alt="The input range field in the Herbie web UI."/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Now that you have an expression and a range for each variable,
    click the "Improve with Herbie" button. You should see the entry
    box gray out, and shortly thereafter some text should appear
    describing what Herbie is doing. After a few seconds, you'll be
    redirected to a page with Herbie's results.
  </p>

  <p>
    The very top of this results page gives some quick statistics
    about the alternative ways Herbie found for evaluating this
    expression:
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="report-large.png" alt="Statistics and error measures for this Herbie run." />
  </figure>

  <p>
    Here, you can see that Herbie's most accurate alternative has an
    accuracy of 99.7%, much better than the initial program's 53.2%,
    and that in total Herbie found 5 alternative. One of those
    alternatives is both more accurate than the original expression
    and also 1.9&times; faster. The <a href="report.html">rest of the
    result page</a> shows each of these alternatives, including
    details like how they were derived. These details are all
    <a href="report.html">documented</a>, but for the sake of the
    tutorial let's move on to a more realistic example.
  </p>

  <h2>Programming with Herbie</h2>

  <p>
    You can use Herbie on expressions from source code, mathematical
    models, or debugging tools. But most users use Herbie as they
    write code, passing any complex floating-point tool to Herbie as
    they go. Herbie has <a href="options.html">options</a> to log all
    the expressions you enter so that you can refer to them later.
  </p>

  <p>But to keep the tutorial focused, let's suppose you're instead
    tracking down a floating-point bug in existing code. Then you'll
    need to start by identifying the problematic floating-point
    expression.</p>

  <p>To demonstrate the workflow, let's walk through
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/208">bug 208</a>
    in <a href="http://mathjs.org">math.js</a>, a math library for
    JavaScript. The bug deals with inaccurate square roots for complex
    numbers. (For a full write-up of the bug itself, check out
    a <a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/casio-mathjs.html">blog
    post</a> by one of the Herbie authors.)
  </p>

  <h2>Finding the problematic expression</h2>

  <p>
    In most programs, there's a small core that does the mathematical
    computations, while the rest of the program sets up parameters,
    handles control flow, visualizes or prints results, and so on. The
    mathematical core is what Herbie will be interested in.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our example, let's start
    in <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/tree/master/lib/function"><code>lib/function/</code></a>.
    This directory contains many subdirectories; each file in each
    subdirectory defines a collection of mathematical functions. The
    bug we're interested in is about complex square root, which is
    defined in
    <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/da306e26ed34272db44e35f07a3b015c0155d99a/lib/function/arithmetic/sqrt.js"><code>arithmetic/sqrt.js</code></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This file handles argument checks, five different number types,
    and error handling, for both real and complex square roots. None
    of that is of interest to Herbie; we want to extract just the
    mathematical core. So skip down to the <code>isComplex(x)</code>
    case:
  </p>

  <pre>var r = Math.sqrt(x.re * x.re + x.im * x.im);
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>This is the mathematical core that we want to send to Herbie.</p>

  <h2>Converting problematic code to Herbie input</h2>

  <p>
    In this code, <code>x</code> is of type <code>Complex</code>, a
    data structure with multiple fields. Herbie only deals with
    floating-point numbers, not data structures, so we will treat the
    input <code>x</code> as two separate inputs to
    Herbie: <code>xre</code> and <code>xim</code>. We'll also pass
    each field of the output to Herbie separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    This code also branches between non-negative <code>x.im</code> and
    negative <code>x.im</code>. It's usually better to send each
    branch to Herbie separately. So in total, this code turns into four
    Herbie inputs: two output fields, for each of the two branches.
  </p>

  <p>Let's focus on the first field of the output for the case of
  non-negative <code>x.im</code>.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>r</code> is an intermediate variable in this
  code block. Intermediate variables provide Herbie with crucial
  information that Herbie can use to improve accuracy, so you want to
  expand or inline them. The result looks like this:</p>

  <pre>0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre * xre + xim * xim) + xre))</pre>

  <p>Recall that this code is only run when <code>x.im</code> is
  non-negative (but it runs for all values of <code>x.re</code>). So, 
  select the full range of values for <code>x.re</code>, but restrict
  the range of <code>x.im</code>, like this: 
  
  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="range-input-2.png" alt="Restricting the input range to xim >= 0." />
  </figure>
  
  This asks Herbie to consider only non-negative
  values of <code>xim</code> when improving the accuracy of this
  expression.</p>
  
  <h2>Herbie's results</h2>

  <p>Herbie will churn for a few seconds and produce a results page.
    In this case, Herbie found 4 alternatives, and we're interested in
    the most accurate one, which should have an
    <a href="error.html">accuracy of 84.6%:</a></p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-highlight.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>Below these summary statistics, we can see a graph of accuracy
  versus input value. By default, it shows accuracy
  versus <code>xim</code>; higher is better:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-xim.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>The drop in accuracy once <code>xim</code> is bigger than
  about <code>1e150</code> really stands out, but you can also see
  that Herbie's alternative more accurate for smaller <code>xim</code>
  values, too. You can also change the graph to plot accuracy
  versus <code>xre</code> instead:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-xre.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>This plot makes it clear that Herbie's alternative is almost
  perfectly accurate for positive <code>xre</code>, but still has some
  error for negative <code>xre</code>.

  <p>Herbie also found other alternatives, which are less accurate but
  might be faster. You can see a summary in this table:</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-pareto-table.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>Herbie's algorithm is randomized, so you likely won't see the
  exact same thing; you might see more or fewer alternatives, and they
  might be more or less accurate and fast. That said, the most
  accurate alternative should be pretty similar.</p>

  <p>That alternative itself is shown lower down on the page:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-improved-accuracy.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>A couple features of this alternative stand out immediately.
  First of all, Herbie inserted an <code>if</code> statement.
  This <code>if</code> statement handles a phenomenon known as
  cancellation, and is part of why Herbie's alternative is more
  accurate. Herbie also replaced the square root operation with
  the <code>hypot</code> function, which computes distances more
  accurately than a direct square root operation.</p>

  <p>If you want to see more about how Herbie derived this result, you
  could click on the word "Derivation" to see a detailed, step-by-step
  explanation of how Herbie did it. For now, though, let's move on to
  look at another alternative.</p>
  
  <p>The fifth alternative suggested by Herbie is much less accurate,
  but it is about twice as fast as the original program:</p>

  <figure>
    <img width="100%" src="problematic-improved-speed.png" />
  </figure>
  
  <p>This alternative is kind of strange: it has two branches, and
  each one only uses one of the two variables <code>xre</code>
  and <code>xim</code>. That explains why it's fast, but it's still
  more accurate than the initial program because it avoids
  cancellation and overflow issues that plagued the original.</p>
  
  <h2>Using Herbie's alternatives</h2>
  
  <p>In this case, we were interested in the most accurate possible
  implementation, so let's try to use Herbie's most accurate
  alternative.</p>

  <pre>
// Herbie version of 0.5 * sqrt(2.0 * (sqrt(xre*xre + xim*xim) + xre))
var r = Math.hypot(x.re, x.im);
var re;
if (xre + r <= 0) {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2 * (x.im / (x.re / x.im) * -0.5));
} else {
    re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2 * (x.re + r));
}
if (x.im &gt;= 0) {
  return new Complex(
      re,
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}
else {
  return new Complex(
      0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + x.re)),
      -0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - x.re))
  );
}</pre>

  <p>Note that I&apos;ve left the Herbie query in a comment. As Herbie
  gets better, you can re-run it on this original expression to see if
  it comes up with improvements in accuracy.</p>

  <p>By the way, for some languages, including JavaScript, you can use
  the drop-down in the top-right corner of the alternative block to
  translate Herbie&apos;s output to that language. However, you will
  still probably need to refactor and modify the results to fit your
  code structure, just like here.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>

  <p>With this change, we&apos;ve made this part of the complex square
  root function much more accurate, and we could repeat the same steps
  for the other branches and other fields in this program. You now
  have a pretty good understanding of Herbie and how to use it.
