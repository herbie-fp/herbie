  <h2>Troubleshooting common errors</h2>
  
  <p>
    Several Herbie error messages refer to this page for additional
    information and debugging tips.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="invalid-program">“Invalid program” error</h3>

  <p>
    This error is most likely due to an error in preparing the input
    to Herbie. Common errors include misspelling function names and
    parenthesizing expressions that must not be parenthesized. The
    stack trace will contain additional information. For example, in
    the expression <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, the use
    of <code>x</code> as invalid because <code>x</code> is a variable,
    so cannot be parenthesized. <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code> would
    be the correct way of describing that expression.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">“Cannot sample enough valid points” error</h3>
  
  <p>
    Herbie uses random sampling to select the points which it will use
    to evaluate the error of an expression. This error occurs when it
    is not able to find enough valid points. For example, consider the
    expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>. This expression yields
    a valid result only when <code>x</code> is between -1001 and -999,
    a rather narrow range.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The solution is to give a <a href="input.html">distribution</a>
    which specifies the bounds on <code>x</code> by adding the line
    <code>:herbie-samplers ([x (uniform -1001 -999)])</code> after the
    parameter list.
