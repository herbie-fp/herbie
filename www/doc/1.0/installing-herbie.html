    <h1>Installing Herbie</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    <a href=".">Herbie</a> depends
    on <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, a dynamic
    language developed by Northeastern University. To install Herbie,
    one must first install Racket. Once Racket is installed, Herbie
    should run without problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing Racket</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie currently supports Linux and OS X. Windows has known bugs
    we are working to resolve, due to the lack of a
    full <code>math.h</code> library. Use
    the <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v6.5.html">official
    installer</a> to install Racket, or use distro-provided packages
    provided they are version 6.4 or later of Racket (earlier versions
    are not supported).
  </p>

  <p>
    Test that Racket is installed correctly and has a correct version:
  </p>

  <pre><strong>$</strong> racket
Welcome to Racket v6.4.
> (exit)</pre>
  
  <h2>Installing Herbie</h2>

  <p>
    Once Racket is installed, download the Herbie source
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie">from GitHub</a> with:
  </p>

  <pre>git clone https://github.com/uwplse/herbie</pre>

  <p>
    If you go to the <code>herbie</code> directory,
    you should see a <code>README.md</code> file, a directory named <code>herbie</code>,
    a directory named <code>bench/</code>, and a variety of other directories.
    Do a trial run of Herbie to make sure everything is installed and working correctly:
  </p>

  <pre>racket src/reports/run.rkt bench/hamming/</pre>

  <p>
    This command will take approximately fifteen minutes to run;
      it runs Herbie on problems from Richard Hamming's
      <i>Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Chapter 3.
    After the command completes,
      a directory named <code>graphs</code> should have appeared.
    Open up the <code>report.html</code> file inside with your browser;
      you should see a listing of the expressions Herbie was run on,
      most of which should be green.
    A score of 24/28 or greater suggests that everything is working correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any of the test results are crashes (there will be a “crashes” count at the top),
      installation issues are to blame.
    Check that your Racket installation is at least version 6.1
      and that you installed Racket from the official installation packages.
    If you're confident the installation is correct
      please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">report the error</a> to the Herbie developers,
      attaching an archive of the complete <code>graphs/</code> directory.
  </p>

  <p>If this all works correctly, you can make Herbie start up faster by byte-compiling it:</p>

  <pre>raco make src/reports/run.rkt</pre>

  <p>
    Once Herbie is installed and working correctly,
