    <h1>Herbie 1.0 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    After two years of work, the <a href=".">Herbie</a> developers are
    excited to announce Herbie 1.0! This is the first release of
    Herbie, marking its transition from research software to a tool
    for scientists and engineers to improve the accuracy of their
    floating point software.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A switch to the standard FPCore <a href="doc/1.0/input.html">input
    format</a>. This makes it easy to use Herbie together with other
    floating point tools,
    like <a href="doc/1.0/using-herbgrind.html">HerbGrind</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a href="/demo/">web demo</a>, which makes it easy to try
    out Herbie and also gives us a sense of what problems people are
    trying to solve using Herbie.</li>
    <li>Easier <a href="doc/1.0/installing-herbie.html">installation</a>.
    We've removed dependencies on several external libraries, upgraded
    to the latest versions of Racket, and eliminated a confusing
    linking step.</li>
    <li>OS X support. We've tracked down several bugs that prevented
    Herbie from working on OS X.</li>
    <li>Support for more functions. Every function available
    in <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/math.h.html">math.h</a>
    is supported, and some additional functions from GNU libc are as
    well.</li>
    <li><a href="doc/1.0/docker.html">Docker support</a> for Herbie. You can
    now use the popular container tool to make installation even
    easier.</li>
    <li>More informative report pages, visible in the web demo, which
    makes them more useful both for users and for debugging. In
    particular, the new graph gives a quick overview of how Herbie did
    on a collection of inputs.</li>
    <li>Make it possible to <a href="doc/1.0/options.html">toggle rulesets</a>
    in Herbie.</li>
    <li>A new entry point into Herbie, cleaning up a haphazard
    collection of different scripts.</li>
    <li>New website!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie is now faster! A new measurement infrastructure helped
    us track down some time sinks.</li>
    <li>Bounds on variables. You can now specifiy bounds within which
    to sample variables.</li>
    <li>Branch on expressions. Herbie can now sometimes infer
    conditionals that use expressions, not variables, to determine
    which expression to use.</li>
    <li>Support expansions around ±∞ in Taylor expansions. The
    framework behind this should eventually make it possible to
    support Puiseux series as well.</li>
    <li>Simplify expressions such as <code>(exp 1)</code>
    or <code>(cos PI)</code>, by supporting symbolic constants in the
    simplification algorithm.</li>
    <li>Faster Taylor series routine. Several large tweaks have helped
    make Taylor series orders of magnitude faster, which has sped up
    Herbie.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use a proper parser for input files. We used to use a bizarre
    system of <code>eval</code>ing input files and poking around
    global storage for the results.</li>
    <li>Many crashes fixed. Herbie is stabler than ever!</li>
    <li>A new debugging and logging system, which makes Herbie
    debugging from the REPL significantly easier</li>
    <li>A new measurement system that lets us see where Herbie spend
    its time. This has helped speed up Herbie.</li>
    <li>A new implementation of the Herbie main loop, which is much
    easier to work with in the debugger.</li>
    <li>Unit tests and more integration with the Racket toolchain.</li>
    <li>A fuzzer for Herbie, which has allowed us to track down many bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
