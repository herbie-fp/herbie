  <p>The <a href="../../"><code>herbie</code></a> command has
  subcommands and options that influence both its user interface and
  the quality of its output.</p>

  <h2>Herbie commands</h2>

  <p>Herbie provides several subcommands, which offer interactive and
    batch modes for both the <a href="using-cli.html">command line</a>
    and the <a href="using-web.html">web interface</a>:<p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>racket -l herbie web</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie <a href="using-web.html">through your browser</a>
      using a local server. This server can also be used
      from <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/odyssey">Odyssey</a>.</dd>

    <dt><code>racket -l herbie shell</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie <a href="using-cli.html">via a command-line shell</a>.
    Enter an <a href="input.html">FPCore expression</a> and Herbie
    prints faster and more accurate alternatives.</dd>

    <dt><code>racket -l herbie improve <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Run Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>. The results are written
    to <var>output</var>, a single file in FPCore format.</dd>

    <dt><code>racket -l herbie report <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Run Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>. The results are written
    to <var>output</var>, a directory of
    HTML <a href="report.html">reports</a>. Viewing these requires a
    web server.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>We recommend the <code>web</code> subcommand for interactive use
  with detailed <a href="report.html">reports</a> that include graphs
  of error versus input values and plots comparing cost and accuracy.
  This can help you understand whether Herbie's improvements matter
  for your use case.</p>

  <p>Use <code>herbie <var>subcommand</var> --help</code> to view
  available command-line options for a subcommand. This command also
  shows undocumented subcommands not listed on this page.</p>

  <h2>General options</h2>

  <p>
    General options apply to all subcommands and are passed after the
    subcommand name but before other arguments, like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">racket -l herbie report --timeout 60 in.fpcore out/</pre>

  <p>Options must go before subcommand arguments like input and output
  paths.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--platform <var>P</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Herbie's backend <a href="platforms.html">platform</a>, which
      affects the operations available to Herbie, their accuracies,
      and their costs. The platform name is either one of the built-in
      platforms, or the path to a <a href="platforms.html">custom
      platform</a>. In general, it's best to select the platform that
      most closely matches the programming language and hardware where
      you will be running floating-point code.</dd>

    <dt><code>--seed <var>S</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The random seed, which changes the randomly-selected points
      that Herbie evaluates candidate expressions on. The seed is a
      number between 0 and 2<sup>31</sup> (not including the latter).
      Two runs of Herbie with the same seed should produce identical
      results. By default, a random seed is chosen.</dd>

    <dt><code>--timeout <var>T</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The timeout to use per-input, in seconds. A fractional number
      of seconds can be given. By default, no timeout is used.</dd>

    <dt><code>--threads <var>N</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-threaded operation. By default, no threads are
      used. The argument is the number of threads to use,
      or <code>yes</code> to use all of the hardware threads.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-points <var>N</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The number of input points Herbie uses to evaluate candidate
      expressions. The default, 256, is a good balance for most
      programs. Increasing this option, say to 512 or 1024, will slow
      Herbie down but may make its results more consistent.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-iters <var>N</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The number of attempts Herbie makes to improve accuracy. The
      default, 4, suffices for most programs, and more iterations are
      rarely beneficial. But increase this option, say to 6, can
      sometimes lead to more accurate or faster results.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-analysis <var>N</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The number of input subdivisions to use when searching for
      valid input points. The default is 12. Increasing this option
      will slow Herbie down, but may fix a
      "<a href="faq.html#sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough
      valid points</a>" error.</dd>
    
    <dt><code>--num-enodes <var>N</var></code></dt>
    <dd>The number of equivalence graph nodes to use when doing
      algebraic reasoning. The default is 4000. Increasing this option
      will slow Herbie down, but may improve results slightly.</dd>
    
  </dl>

  <h2>Web shell options</h2>
  
  <p>The <code>web</code> tool runs Herbie and connects to it from
  your browser. It has options to control the underlying web
  server.</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><code>--port N</code></dt>
    <dd>The port the Herbie server runs on. The default port is 8000.</dd>

    <dt><code>--save-session dir</code></dt>
    <dd>Save all the reports to this directory. The directory also
    caches previously-computed expressions.</dd>

    <dt><code>--log file</code></dt>
    <dd>Write an access log to this file, formatted like an Apache
    log. This log does <em>not</em> contain crash tracebacks.</dd>

    <dt><code>--quiet</code></dt>
    <dd>By default, but not when this option is set, a browser is
    automatically started to show the Herbie page. This option also
    shrinks the text printed on start up.</dd>

    <dt><code>--no-browser</code></dt>
    <dd>This flag disables the default behavior of opening the Herbie page in your default browser.</dd>

    <dt><code>--public</code></dt>
    <dd>When set, users on other computers can connect to the demo and
    use it. (In other words, the server listens
    on <code>0.0.0.0</code>.) Essential when Herbie is run
    from <a href="docker.html">Docker</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Rulesets</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie uses rewrite rules to change programs and improve accuracy.
    The <code>--disable rules:<var>group</var></code>
    and <code>--enable rules:<var>group</var></code> options turn rule
    sets on and off. In general, turning a ruleset on makes Herbie
    produce more accurate programs.
  </p>

  <p>The full list of rule groups is:</p>

  <table class="function-list">
    <thead><tr><th>Rule Group</th><th>Topic of rewrite rules</th></tr></thead>
    <tr><td>arithmetic</td><td>Basic arithmetic facts</td></tr>
    <tr><td>polynomials</td><td>Factoring and powers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>fractions</td><td>Fraction arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>exponents</td><td>Exponentiation identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>trigonometry</td><td>Trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>hyperbolic</td><td>Hyperbolic trigonometric identities</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Search options</h2>

  <p>These options enable or disable transformations that Herbie uses
    to find candidate programs. We recommend sticking to the
    defaults.</p>

  <p>
    Each option can be turned off with the <code>-o</code>
    or <code>--disable</code> command-line flag and on with
    <code>+o</code> or <code>--enable</code>. Turning an option off
    typically results in less-accurate results, while turning a option
    on typically results in more confusing output expressions.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>setup:search</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses interval subdivision search
    to help compute ground truth for complicated expressions. If
    turned off, Herbie will be slightly faster, but may hit the
    "<a href="faq.html#sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid
    points</a>" error more often. Instead of turning this option off,
    try adjusting the <kbd>--num-analysis</kbd> flag.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:preprocess</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses identities of the input
    expression (like even or symmetric expressions) to perform
    rewriting more effectively. If turned off, Herbie will skip
    preprocessing and work directly with the original expression. This
    can be faster but may produce less accurate results for
    expressions with exploitable symmetries.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:rr</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses algebraic rewriting to
    generate candidate programs. This is Herbie's primary method of
    improving accuracy, and we do not recommend turning off this
    option.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses series expansion to generate
    candidate programs. If turned off, Herbie will not use series
    expansion, which may help accuracy in some ranges while leaving
    Herbie unable to solve certain under- and overflow issues.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:evaluate</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses arbitrary-precision
    arithmetic to generate candidate programs, specifically by exactly
    computing some constant expressions. If turned off, these exact
    computations won't be performed and Herbie won't be able to
    improve accuracy in those cases.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:proofs</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, generates step-by-step derivations
    for HTML reports. If turned off, the step-by-step derivations will
    be absent, and Herbie will be slightly faster.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:regimes</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's regime inference
    algorithm to branch between several program candidates. If turned
    off, branches will not be inferred and the output program will be
    straight-line code (if the input was). Instead of turning this
    option off, consider increasing your platform's
    <a href="platforms.html"><code>if</code> cost</a> to discourage
    branches.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:binary-search</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses binary search to refine the
    values used in inferred branches. If turned off, different runs of
    Herbie will be less consistent, and accuracy near branches will
    suffer.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:branch-expressions</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, allows Herbie to branch on
      expressions, not just variables. This slows Herbie down,
      particularly for large programs. If turned off, Herbie will only
      try to branch on variables.</dd>
