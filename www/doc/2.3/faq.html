  <p><a href="../../">Herbie</a> issues a variety of warnings and
  errors when something unexpected happens during compilation.</p>


  <h2>Common warnings</h2>

  <h3 id="inf-points"><var>N</var>% of points produce a very large (infinite) output.</h3>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes, an input to your expression produces an output so large
    that it's best represented by a floating-point infinity. For
    example, <code>(exp 1000)</code> is over 10<sup>434</sup>, so it's
    much larger than the largest floating-point value. Herbie raises
    this warning when too many inputs (more than 20% of them) are this
    large. When you see this warning, you should usually set a more
    restrictive precondition.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ground-truth">Could not determine a ground truth</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie raises this warning when some inputs require more than
    10,000 bits to compute an exact ground truth. For example, to
    compute <code>(/ (exp x) (exp x))</code> for <code>x =
    1e100</code>, absurdly large numbers would be required. Herbie
    discards these inputs and raises this warning. When you see this
    warning, you should usually set a more restrictive precondition.
  </p>

  <h3 id="value-to-string">Could not uniquely print <var>val</var></h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when it needs more than 10,000 bits
    to produce a unique decimal representation for a given value. This
    is likely the result of a bug in a custom platform, likely in
    a <a href="plugins.html">representation definition</a>. The
    platform needs to be fixed.
  </p>

  <h3 id="unused-variable">Unused variable <var>var</var></h3>
  
  <p>
    The input FPCore contains a variable that is not used in the body
    expression. You should remove the unused variable.
  </p>

  <h3 id="strange-variable">Unusual variable <var>var</var></h3>
  
  <p>
    The input expression contains a variable that is named similar to
    some named constant, like <var>e</var> instead of <var>E</var>.
    You should use a different variable name.
  </p>

  <h2>Common errors</h2>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">Invalid syntax</h3>

  <p>This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
  include misspelled function names and parenthesized expressions that
  should not be parenthesized. For example, in <code>(- (exp (x))
  1)</code>, the expression <code>x</code> is a variable so shouldn't
  be parenthesized; <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code> is correct. Follow
  the <a href="input.html">input format</a> more carefully.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid points</h3>

  <p>This error occurs when Herbie is unable to find enough valid
  points. For example, the expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>
  is invalid unless <code>(&lt;= -1001 x -999)</code>, a rather narrow
  range. You can specify a more restrictive precondition or pass a
  larger value for
  the <a href="options.html"><code>--num-analysis</code> flag</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">No valid values</h3>

  <p>This error indicates that your input has no valid inputs, usually
  due to an overly restriction precondition. For example, the
  precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code> excludes all inputs. You
  should fix either the precondition or the input program.</p>
