  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 2.2! This release focuses extensible compilation targets
  using <i>platforms</i>.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie compiles mathematical expressions
  to fast and accurate floating point programs, avoiding the bugs,
  errors, and surprises of floating point arithmetic.

  <h2>Releasing the Platforms API</h2>

  <figure class="showcase">
    <pre>(define-operation (cosd [x &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
          #:spec (cos (* x (/ (PI) 180)))
          #:impl (from-rival)
          #:cost 12.5)</pre>

    <figcaption>
      Herbie 2.2's <a href="platforms.html">platforms</a> allow you to
      define custom compilation targets, including novel hardware
      (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs), programming languages (Julia, Matlab,
      Fortran), or software libraries (Numpy, Eigen, cuBLAS).
      Platforms can define new number formats, new floating-point
      operations on those formats, and new cost models for those
      operations. Herbie will automatically optimize its results for
      your platform.

  <p>
  Last year, <a href="../2.1/release-notes.html">Herbie 2.1</a>
  included the beginnings of <i>platforms</i>, Herbie's API for
  multiple backends. We've simplified and improved this API, and are
  now ready to release it.</p>
  
  <p>In short, platforms allow you define the functions Herbie is
  allowed to use when compiling floating-point programs. A platform
  can expose Python's <code>fsum</code>, Julia's <code>cosd</code>, or
  AVX's <code>rcpps</code> to Herbie, which can then use those
  functions to produce even faster and more accurate output.
  Our <a href="../papers.html">recent publications</a> demonstrate
  dramatic accuracy and performance improvements using platforms.</p>

  <p>Platforms are a large change, and we invite users to try it out.
  The <a href="platforms.html">platforms documentation</a> explains
  how to select different built-in platforms, or even how to write
  your own.</p>
  
  <p>Besides the new feature, platforms allow us to deprecate a
  variety of now-superseded features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The default platform now uses a realistic, auto-tuned cost
    model which should lead to faster code in practice.</li>

    <li>The Herbie 2.0 and 2.1 cost models are replaced by
    the <code>herbie20</code> platform.</li>

    <li>The <code>--no-pareto</code> flag is replaced by
    the <code>herbie10</code> platform.</li>

    <li>Plugins are now replaced by ordinary Racket libraries imported
    directly by plugins.</li>
    
    <li>Preprocessing is now replaced by standard platform-provided
    functions such
    as <code>fmin</code>, <code>fmax</code>, <code>fabs</code>,
    and <code>copysign</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Restructuring the Main Loop</h2>
  
  <figure class="showcase">
    <img src="system-2.2.png"
         alt="The new Herbie main loop.
              The simplify step and patch table have been removed,
              while the compute phase has been added.">
    <figcaption>
      The Herbie main loop is dramatically simplified, with no
      separate simplify or localize phase and a new compute phase that
      aid with hard-to-compute constants.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>We've overhauled the Herbie main loop, which is the high-level
  algorithm that invokes different Herbie sub-systems to generate and
  filter different candidate programs. This overhaul both introduces
  new systems, which should make Herbie more capable, and reduce
  duplicative work, dramatically speeding up Herbie. Specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A new compute phase was added, which replaces variable-free
      subexpressions with constants. The constants are computed using
      high-precision arithmetic and are guaranteed to be exact.</li>
    <li>The simplification phase was removed. This phase mostly
      duplicated work already done by the rewrite phase, so removing it
      had very little impact on performance and accuracy of generated
      code, but reduced Herbie runtime significantly.</li>
    <li>The localize phase was also removed. This phase existed to
      reduce duplicate work in other phases; batches deduplicate the
      work automatically so localize is no longer needed. Removing this
      phase also significantly sped up Herbie.</li>
    <li>Minor phases like initial and final simplify were removed as
      well. Most importantly, this allowed replacing the existing,
      complex "accelerator" API (never fully released) and replace it
      with the much simpler "platform" API.</li>
    <li>Herbie more correctly tracks Taylor approximations inside
      Herbie, and will now avoid making "approximations to
      approximations" leading to runaway error in rare cases.</li>
  </ul>
      

  <h2>Flattening Expressions to Batches</h2>

  <figure class="showcase side-by-side">
    <pre>%0 = x
%1 = (literal 1)
%2 = (+ %0 %1)
%3 = (* %2 %2)
%4 = (- %3 %1)
%5 = (neg %2)
%6 = (* %5 %5)
%7 = (- %6 %1))</pre>
    <figcaption>
      An example of a batch, containing two expressions (and their
      subexpressions): <code>(x + 1)<sup>2</sup> - 1</code>
      and <code>(-(x + 1))<sup>2</sup> - 1</code>. Shared
      subexpressions are only represented once in the batch, and are
      only processed once by Herbie.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>We have also changed Herbie's main data structure for
  representing programs. Until now, Herbie represented programs via
  their abstract syntax tree. While simple and effective, this
  representation lead to processing identical subexpressions
  repeatedly. This was especially problematic for larger programs,
  which can sometimes have the same subexpression appear exponentially
  many times.</p>

  <p>The batch data structure instead uses a flat array with
  back-references to represent programs, which means that duplicate
  subexpressions appear and are processed just once. This lead to
  significant speedups throughout Herbie:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Batches automatically deduplicates identical candidate
      programs, which occur when multiple Herbie phases produce the
      same output. There were a lot more of these than we thought; in
      some cases as much as 25&times; deduplication occurs.</li>
    <li>The series phase, now uses batches internally, allowing Herbie
      to consider many more series expansions.</li>
    <li>Herbie's FFI layer for interacting with
      the <a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io/">egg</a> library now
      leverages batches to reduce time spent copying data in and out of
      egg.</li>
    <li> In some cases, one batch is shared across multiple phases
      (like evaluation and pruning), reducing duplication even
      further.</li>
    <li>The derivations phase was dramatically sped up by caching
      proof objects across multiple candidate programs. Additionally,
      a debugging pass called "soundiness" was removed entirely, since
      the problems it was built to debug no longer occur. Thanks to
      both changes, derivations take almost no time at all any
      more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sister Projects</h2>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/odyssey">Odyssey
      numerics workbench</a> is releasing version 1.2 today, featuring
      a new "local error" component and various design tweaks and
      improvements. Odyssey can be tried from
      its <a href="https://herbie-fp.github.io/odyssey/">online
      demo</a> or installed locally from
      the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=herbie-fp.odyssey-fp">VS
      Code Marketplace</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/rival">Rival
    real-arithmetic package</a> is releasing version 2.2 today,
    including various tweaks, optimizations, and improvements. Most
    significantly, a new "hints" feature significantly speeds up
    sampling expressions that
    use <code>fmin</code>, <code>fmax</code>, and <code>if</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Herbie now offers a basic <a href="api-endpoints.html">HTTP
        API</a>, including both synchronous and asynchronous jobs and
      access to various internal Herbie features. This HTTP API is a
      work in progress and is primarily built to support Odyssey.
      However, our work on the API has also enabled the
      standard <a href="using-web.html">Herbie web interface</a> to
      support <a href="options.html">threads</a>, which should make
      Herbie faster in a lot of common use cases.</li>
    <li>Small quality-of-life changes have been made to the Herbie
      reports, including hiding duplicate alternatives, updating
      various dependencies, and generating the reports more
      quickly.</li>
    <li>Optional, off-by-default support for
      the <a href="https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog">egglog</a>
      rewriting engine has been added. We are excited about growth and
      competition among rewrite engines and hope to continue driving
      forward this research area.</li>
    <li>Fixing a variety of small bugs, such as nondeterminism due to
      an incorrect type signature for <code>fma</code> and new rewrite
      rules to unlock more accurate results.</li>
    <li>Many general-purpose cleanups, including removing a lot of
      now-unnecessary nightly infrastructure, adoption of a new
      formatting guideline, reorganization of the source code, and new
      debug infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
