  <p>
    After six months of work, the <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers
    are excited to announce Herbie 1.1! This release focuses on making
    Herbie easier to use, including a web interface, clear syntax
    errors, and detailed reports. This release also expands support
    for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and speeds up
    preconditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../papers.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.

  <h2>Breaking Changes and Deprecations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> In line
    with <a href="http://fpbench.org/spec/fpcore-1.0.html">FPCore
    1.0</a>, we have removed support for the <code>cotan</code>
    function, renamed <code>=</code> to <code>==</code>, and added
    the <code>!=</code> function.</li>
    <li>In line with the new syntax for calling Herbie from the
    command line, the old syntax is deprecated and will be removed in
    the next version.</li>
    <li>In line with the faster preconditions, we have deprecated
    the <code>:herbie-samplers</code> property and will remove it in
    the next release.</li>
    <li>We have changed the syntax for
    specifying <a href="options.html">search options</a> for Herbie.
    Instead of using <code>-o</code> to toggle options,
    use <code>-o</code> to disable options and <code>+o</code> to
    enable them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="using-web.html#batch">HTML reports</a>. Herbie can
      now generate reports that show graphs, describe how Herbie
      achieved its result, and more.</li>
    <li><a href="using-web.html#interactive">Web shell</a>. The
      old <a href="/demo/">web demo</a> has been cleaned up and made
      available to users, providing a graphical interface to
      Herbie.</li>
    <li><a href="using-cli.html#batch">Batch mode</a>. It's now
      simpler to run Herbie on an FPCore file and save the results in
      an output file.
      The <a href="using-cli.html#interactive">command-line shell</a>
      is also more user-friendly.</li>
    <li>Easier <a href="installing.html">installation</a> using
      the Racket package manager.</li>
    <li>Simpler, clearer syntax errors. Instead of stack traces,
      syntax errors now come with file, line, and column
      information.</li>
  </ul>

    <figcaption>Improvement on the Hamming benchmarks from Herbie 1.0 to Herbie 1.1. The improved series expansions, expanded trigonometric and hyperbolic knowledge, and miscellaneous bug fixes have made Herbie smarter.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Faster preconditions. A precondition like <code>(&lt; 10 x
      12)</code> now causes Herbie to only sample points in the
      relevant range, significantly speeding up Herbie and obviating
      many "cannot sample enough valid points" errors.</li>
    <li>Better support for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
      We've taught Herbie about many trigonometric identities, which
      it can now use to improve expressions.</li>
    <li>Better series expansion. We've taught Herbie to take series
      expansions of many more functions.</li>
    <li>Zero-argument expressions are now supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We have a new, right-facing logo!</li>
    <li>We now have a complete syntax checker for inputs, giving the
      Herbie core confidence that it's dealing with valid expressions.</li>
    <li>The infrastructure for generating reports has been cleaned up.</li>
    <li>The web demo has been rearchitected. It no longer needs to
      output files, no longer uses continuations, and is now much more configurable.</li>
    <li>The new command-line syntax unifies the mess of invokable
      scripts in Herbie. We will continue the unification in future
      releases.</li>
    <li>More unit tests continue to be written, and including a test
      that ensures that all our rules are valid.</il>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
