  <p>Platforms define <a href="../../">Herbie</a> compilation targets.
  A platform might be specific to a programming language, to a math
  library, or to a hardware ISA. Writing a custom platforms can help
  Herbie produce faster and more accurate programs.</p>

  <h2>Platform Concepts</h2>
  
  <p>Herbie operates on mathematical specifications and floating-point
  expressions.</p>

  <p><dfn>Specifications</dfn> are built from rational numbers,
  variables, and <dfn>functions</dfn> like <code>+</code>,
  <code>sin</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>if</code>. A
  specification has a <dfn>type</dfn>, which is
  either <code>real</code> or <code>bool</code>.</p>

  <p>Types, functions, and specifications have floating-point
  analogs.</p>
  
  <p><dfn>Representations</dfn> are the floating-point analogs of
  types, and Herbie comes with three built in:
  <code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code> are
  reprentations of <code>real</code> and correspond to single- and
  double-precision IEEE-754 arithmetic. There's also
  a <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code> representation for booleans. It's
  possible to define new representations, described
  on <a href="plugins.html">another page</a>.</p>

  <p><dfn>Operations</dfn> are the floating-point analog of functions
  and represent the actual floating-point operation the compilation
  target can perform. There are typically several operations for each
  supported function; for example, in the C standard library
  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math/cos.html">provides</a>
  <code>cosf</code> and <code>cos</code>, both of which correspond to
  the <code>cos</code> function but for different representations
  (<code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code>).</p>
  
  <p><dfn>Expressions</dfn> are the floating-point analog of
  specifications and represent target-specific floating-point
  computations. Platforms, to put it simply, just define the set of
  representations and operations that expressions are allowed to use.
  Herbie then searches for a fast and accurate expression that
  corresponds to the user's input specification.</p>

  <p>Each representation, operation, and thus expression has a
  <dfn>cost</dfn>, which is a non-negative real number. Generally, the
  cost of a representation is the time it takes to read a value of
  that representation from memory and the cost of an operation is the
  time it takes to execute that operation. However, in principle,
  platforms can use cost to represent another metric like area or
  latency. Only relative costs matter. If you're not sure, just
  putting "<code>1</code>" for all the costs is not a bad place to
  start.</p>
  
  <h2>Defining a Platform</h2>

  <p>A platform definition is a text file that starts with:</p>

  <pre>#lang herbie/platform</pre>
  
  <p>Herbie can then be informed to use this platform by passing
  the <code>--platform <var>path/to/file</var></code> <a href="options.html">command-line
  argument</a>.</p>

  <p>The file contains <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>
  code. That code can define the platform's representations and
  operations using <code>define-representation</code>
  and <code>define-operation</code>. It can also define variables and
  helper functions, import external packages, or anything else Racket
  can do. If necessary, it can define new representations.</p>
  
  <p>Herbie's <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie/tree/main/src/platforms">built-in
  platforms</a> are good example platforms to study or modify. If you
  use them as an example, you'll need to change the <code>#lang</code>
  line at the top of the file to be <code>herbie/platforms</code>; the
  built-in platforms are different because they are built in to Herbie
  and can't assume Herbie is installed.</p>

  <h2>Defining Representations</h2>

  <p>The typical platform starts by defining the representations it
  uses and their costs with <code>define-representation<code>:</p>

  <pre>(define-representation &lt;bool&gt; #:cost 1)
(define-representation &lt;binary64&gt; #:cost 1.5)</pre>

  <p>This cost is the cost for reading a variable or literal of that
  representation. Note that platforms must explicitly define a cost
  for the <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code> representation if it uses
  booleans. If the platform forgets to define a representation that it
  uses, Herbie will produce an error when loading the platform.</p>

  <p>If the same cost is used repeatedly, it can be convenient to
  define a variable:</p>

  <pre>(define cost 1)
(define-representation &lt;bool&gt; #:cost cost)</pre>
  
  <p>After defining the representations it uses, a platform then
  defines all the operations it supports.</p>
  
  <h2>Defining Operations</h2>

  <p>An operation is defined by four fields:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <dfn>signature</dfn>, which gives the operation's name and
    its input and output representations.</li>

    <li>A <dfn>specification</dfn> for the operation's mathematical
    behavior.</li>

    <li>An <dfn>implementation</dfn> that computes the operation's
    output given concrete inputs.</li>

    <li>A <dfn>cost</dfn> for using the operation in an
    expression.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The <code>define-operation</code> construct requires exactly
  these four fields:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (recip [x &lt;binary32&gt;]) &lt;binary32&gt;
  #:spec (/ 1 x) #:impl (lambda (x) ...) #:cost 3)</pre>

  <p>The first line gives the operation's signature: it is
  named <code>recip</code>, it has one single-precision
  input <code>x</code>, and it outputs a single-precision float.</p>

  <p>The <code>#:spec</code> field gives this operation's
  specification as <code>(/ 1 x)</code>, one divided
  by <code>x</code>. In other words, this operation computes a
  number's reciprocal.</p>

  <p>The <code>#:impl</code> field gives this operation's
  implementation, as a Racket function (defined
  with <code>lambda</code>). An operation's implementation is a Racket
  function with as many arguments as the operation. It is called with
  concrete inputs in the corresponding input representations, and must
  return an output in the output representation. It can be defined
  using a <code>lambda</code>, a <code>define</code> block, or any
  other function-defining Racket construct.</p>

  <p>When an implementation function is called,
  <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code>
  arguments are passed as Racket
  <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/performance.html#%28tech._flonum%29">flonums</a>,
  while <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code> arguments are passed as Racket
  <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._boolean~3f%29%29">booleans</a>.
  Single-precision numbers aren't a separate type in Racket. instead,
  you create them from double-precision floats by
  calling <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/flonums.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fflonum..rkt%29._flsingle%29%29"><code>flsingle</code></a>.</p>

  <p>For this example, to compute a 32-bit reciprocal for a 32-bit
  input, one could use <code>(flsingle (/ 1.0 x))</code> for the body
  of the <code>lambda</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code>#:cost</code> field gives this operation's cost, 3.</p>

  <h2>Defining Multiple Operations</h2>
  
  <p>Realistic platform usually have a lot of similar operations:
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, or sine,
  cosine, tangent, and so on. The <code>define-operations</code>
  construct defines multiple operations at a time, as long as they
  have the same input and output representations:</p>

  <pre>(define-operations ([x &lt;binary64&gt;] [y &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
    [+ #:spec (+ x y) #:impl + #:cost 0.200]
    [- #:spec (- x y) #:impl - #:cost 0.200]
    [* #:spec (* x y) #:impl * #:cost 0.250]
    [/ #:spec (/ x y) #:impl / #:cost 0.350])</pre>

  <p>This block defines four functions, each with their own name,
  specification, implementation, and cost. Note that in this case
  the <code>#:impl</code> column refers to the Racket
  functions <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
  and <code>/</code>.</p>

  <h2>Common Kinds of Operations</h2>

  <p>This section lists common kinds of operations and notes things
  you should keep in mind when defining them.</p>

  <h3>Math Library Functions</h3>

  <p>Most operating systems have a standard <code>libm</code> library
  that provides elementary functions like <code>cos</code>. You can
  use Herbie's <code>from-libm</code> helper to load implementations
  from <code>libm</code>:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (fabs.f32 [x &lt;binary32&gt;]) &lt;binary32&gt;
  #:spec (fabs x) #:impl (from-libm 'fabsf) #:cost 0.125)</pre>

  <p>The <code>from-libm</code> uses dynamic linking to
  load <code>libm</code>, extracts the symbol passed
  to <code>from-libm</code>, and then uses the operation's signature
  to call into the dynamically-linked library from Racket. Must make
  sure to pass the correct symbol name; for single-precision
  functions, make sure to add the "<code>f</code>" suffix.</p>

  <h3>Numeric Variations</h3>

  <p>Some platforms provide numeric variations like <code>log1p</code>
  or <code>cosd</code> for common functions. You can define operations
  for them using complex specifications:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (cosd [x &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
  #:spec (cos (* x (/ (PI) 180))) #:impl (lambda (x) ...) #:cost 4)</pre>

  <p>The <code>#:spec</code> in this example explains to Herbie
  that <code>cosd</code> is the cosine of <code>x</code> in degrees.
  Herbie will then use <code>cosd</code> when that improves
  accuracy.</p>

  <p>Other common numeric variations
  include <code>fma</code>, <code>log1p</code>, <code>expm1</code>,
  and <code>hypot</code>. If they're available on your target,
  we <em>strongly</em> recommend defining operations for them; they
  often improve accuracy by quite a bit!</p>

  <h3>Conversions</h3>

  <p>A conversion or cast operation uses mixed representations:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (64-&gt;32 [x &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary32&gt;
  #:spec x #:impl flsingle #:cost 1)</pre>

  <p>This operation has a 64-bit input and a 32-bit output. Its
  specification is just <code>x</code>, which means it doesn't
  actually do anything mathematically. The implementation is the
  standard Racket <code>flsingle</code> function (which converts from
  double- to single-precision) and it has a cost of 1.</p>

  <p>Herbie will use this conversion operation for casting between the
  two types.</p>

  <h3>Comparisons</h3>

  <p>Comparison operations return <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code>:</p>

  <pre>(define-operations ([x &lt;binary64&gt;] [y &lt;binary64&gt;]) <bool>
  [==.f64 #:spec (== x y) #:impl =          #:cost 1]
  [!=.f64 #:spec (!= x y) #:impl (negate =) #:cost 1]
  [&lt;.f64  #:spec (&lt; x y)  #:impl &lt;          #:cost 1]
  [&gt;.f64  #:spec (&gt; x y)  #:impl &gt;          #:cost 1]
  [&lt;=.f64 #:spec (&lt;= x y) #:impl &lt;=         #:cost 1]
  [&gt;=.f64 #:spec (&gt;= x y) #:impl &gt;=         #:cost 1])</pre>
  
  <p>Here, <code>negate</code> is
  a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/procedures.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Ffunction..rkt%29._negate%29%29">Racket
  function</a> that negates a comparison function.</p>

  <p>A platform only needs to provide the comparison functions
  available on the target. However, Herbie's "regimes" pass uses
  the <code>&lt;=</code> operation, so it's best to provide one if one
  is available.</p>

  <p>A platform that uses both representation needs to define
  separate <code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code> comparison operations. They can
  have different costs.</p>

  <h3>Conditionals</h3>

  <p>Conditionals can be defined as operations with a boolean argument:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (if-f64 [c <bool>] [t &lt;binary64&gt;] [f &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
  #:spec (if c t f) #:impl if-impl
  #:cost 14 #:aggregate if-cost)</pre>

  <p>Here <code>if-impl</code> is a Herbie-provided Racket function
  that wraps a standard <code>if</code> statement, while
  the <code>if<code> inside the <code>#:spec</code> is how
  specifications refer to mathematical conditional expressions.</p>

  <p>Besides the standard <code>#:cost</code> field, conditional
  operations should usually also specify <code>if-cost</code> for
  the <code>#:aggregate</code> field. This informs Herbie that the
  cost of an <code>if-f64</code> should only consider the bigger of
  the true and false branches' costs. If the <code>#:aggregate</code>
  field is removed, Herbie will add the costs costs of both branches,
  just like a normal operation, even though only one branch is
  actually executed. Other operations can also use aggregate
  functions, but there's usually not a good reason for this.</p>

  <p>A platform needs to define both <code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code> conditional operations if it uses
  both representations. They can have different costs. There's
  typically no need to define conditional operations
  for <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code> as Herbie does not rewrite boolean
  expressions.</p>

  <h3>Constants</h3>

  <p>Mathematical constants like <code>E</code> and <code>PI</code>
  are considered operations in Herbie; they just have no inputs. For
  example, to define a 64-bit inverse-&pi; constant, write:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (INVPI) &lt;binary64&gt;
  #:spec (/ 1 (PI)) #:impl (lambda () ...) #:fpcore PI #:cost 0.5)</pre>

  <p>Note the parentheses in various fields. The
  name <code>INVPI</code> has parentheses around it like all operation
  signatures; it just doesn't have any arguments after the name. In
  the <code>#:spec</code>, the <code>PI</code> constant is also
  wrapped in parentheses because it is also treated as a zero-argument
  function. And in the <code>#:impl</code>, the implementation is
  given by a Racket function of no arguments. You can also use
  the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/procedures.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Ffunction..rkt%29._const%29%29">Racket <code>const</code>
  function</a> to construct these no-argument functions.</p>

  <p>But in the <code>#:fpcore</code> field the <code>PI</code> value
  doesn't use parentheses, because FPCore treats constants as
  constants, not zero-argument functions.</p>

  <p>Constants can be defined in any precision. If you want the same
  constant to be available in multiple precisions, you have to define
  multiple constant operations.</p>

  <h3>Negation</h3>

  <p>Herbie's specification language has a negation function, and it's
  usually a good idea to define a negation operation if your target
  has one. Define it like this:</p>

  <pre>(define-operation (neg.f32 [x &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
    #:spec (neg x) #:impl - #:fpcore (- x) #:cost 0.125)</pre>

  <p>Here, in the <code>#:spec</code>, <code>(neg x)</code> refers to
  the negation function in Herbie's specification language, while
  the <code>-</code> symbol after <code>#:impl</code> refers to
  Racket's subtraction function, which also acts as a negation
  function.</p>

  <p>There is also an <code>#:fpcore</code> field. This field tells
  Herbie how to represent this operation in FPCore (for user input and
  output). The default <code>#:fpcore</code> is the operation's
  <code>#:spec</code> but there are a few functions (like negation)
  where Herbie's specification language uses a different syntax from
  FPCore and <code>#:fpcore</code> needs to be specified manually.</p>

  <h3>Precision-specific Variations</h3>

  <p>If a platform supports both <code>&lt;binary32&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;binary64&gt;</code>, they often support similar
  operations:</p>

  <pre>(define-operations ([x &lt;binary32&gt;]) &lt;binary32&gt;
    #:fpcore (:precision binary32)
    [fabs.f32 #:spec (fabs x) #:impl (from-libm 'fabsf) #:cost 0.125]
    [sin.f32  #:spec (sin x)  #:impl (from-libm 'sinf)  #:cost 4.250]
    ...)
  (define-operations ([x &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
    #:fpcore (:precision binary64)
    [fabs.f64 #:spec (fabs x) #:impl (from-libm 'fabs)  #:cost 0.125]
    [sin.f64  #:spec (sin x)  #:impl (from-libm 'sin)   #:cost 4.200]
    ...)</pre>

  <p>Here, two <code>define-operations</code> blocks define two sets
  of functions with different signatures but identical specifications.
  To disambiguate these functions in FPCore output,
  the <code>#:fpcore</code> argument to <code>define-operations</code>
  defines <a href="input.html">different FPCore properties</a> for
  each set of operations.</p>

  <h3>Hard-to-emulate Operations</h3>

  <p>Sometimes a platform will offer an operation that's difficult to
  implement accurately. In this case, Herbie's <code>from-rival</code>
  helper can provide a slow but correctly-rounded implementation:</p>

  <pre>(define-opertion (dotprod [a &lt;binary64&gt;] [b &lt;binary64&gt;]
                            [c &lt;binary64&gt;] [d &lt;binary64&gt;]) &lt;binary64&gt;
  #:spec (+ (* a b) (* c d)) #:impl (from-rival) #:cost 1.25)</pre>

  <p>The <code>from-rival</code> helper uses
  the <a href="https://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a> library to evaluate the
  operation's specification. Compilation is usually <em>much</em>
  slower than with a native floating-point implementation, but for
  unusual operations that are difficult to implement otherwise, it can
  still allow compilation to proceed.</p>

  <p>Note that <code>from-rival</code> implementations are always
  "correctly-rounded", meaning as accurate as possible. Most targets
  don't actually offer correctly-rounded operations, which can mean
  that Herbie's outputs won't be as accurate as Herbie assumes. It's
  always better to execute the actual operation on the actual target
  if possible, so as to precisely emulate its actual behavior.</p>
