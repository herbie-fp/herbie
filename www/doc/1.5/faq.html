  <p><a href="../../">Herbie</a> automatically transforms floating
  point expressions into more accurate forms. This page troubleshoots
  common Herbie errors, warnings, and known issues.</p>


  <h2>Common errors</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie error messages refer to this second for additional
    information and debugging tips.
  </p>

  <h3 id="hangs">Herbie hangs forever</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie 1.5 on Racket 8.0 through 8.2 sometimes hangs due to a bugs
    in both Herbie and Racket. Please reinstall Herbie 1.5; we
    re-released it with a fix for this bug.
  </p>

  <h3 id="invalid-syntax">Invalid syntax</h3>

  <p>
    This error means you mis-formatted Herbie's input. Common errors
    include misspelled function names and parenthesized expressions
    that should not be parenthesized. For example, in
    <code>(- (exp (x)) 1)</code>, the expression <code>x</code> is a
    variable so shouldn't be parenthesized. <code>(- (exp x) 1)</code>
    would be the correct way to write that expression.
    The <a href="input.html">input format</a> documentation has more
    details on Herbie's syntax.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough valid points</h3>

  <p>This error occurs when Herbie is unable to find enough valid
  points. For example, the expression <code>(acos (+ 1000 x))</code>
  is invalid unless <code>(&lt;= -1001 x -999)</code>, a rather narrow
  range. The simplest fix is to increase
  the <a href="options.html"><code>--num-analysis</code> flag</a>.
  Specifying the range of valid points as
  a <a href="input.html#preconditions">precondition</a> can also help.
  </p>

  <h3 id="no-valid-values">No valid values</h3>

  <p>This error indicates that your input has no valid inputs, usually
  due to an overly restriction precondition. For example, the
  precondition <code>(&lt 3 x 2)</code> excludes all inputs. The
  solution is to fix the precondition or input program.</p>

  <h3 id="mpfr-prec-limit">Exceeded MPFR precision limit</h3>

  <p>This rare error indicates that Herbie could not compute a "ground
  truth" for your expression. For some expressions, like <code>(sin
  (exp x))</code>, calculating a correct output for large input values
  requires exponentially many bits. Herbie raises this error when more
  than 10,000 bits are required.</p>


  <h2>Common warnings</h2>

  <p>Herbie warnings refer to this section for explanations and common
  actions to take.</p>

  <h3 id="ground-truth">Could not determine a ground truth</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie raises this warning when some inputs require more than
    10 000 bits to compute an exact ground truth. For example, to
    compute <code>(/ (exp x) (exp x))</code> for very
    large <code>x</code>, absurdly large exponents would be required.
    Herbie discards such inputs and raises this warning. If you see
    this warning, you should add a restrictive precondition, such
    as <code>:pre (&lt; -100 x 100)</code>, to prevent large inputs.
  </p>

  <h3 id="deprecated-ops">Operator <var>op</var> is deprecated</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie raises this warning when an operation is no longer supported.
    Input expressions containing these operators may not be portable
      across different platforms.
    Consider creating a plugin to support them.
  </p>

  <h3 id="value-to-string">Could uniquely print <var>val</var></h3>

  <p>
    Herbie will raise this warning when it needs more than 10,000 bits
    to produce a string representation for a given value. This is
    likely the result of a bug in a third-party plugin.
  </p>

  <h3 id="egg-herbie">Falling back on regraph because egg-herbie package not installed</h3>

  <p>
    Herbie can use either the <code>egg-herbie</code>
    or <code>regraph</code> package to simplify
    expressions; <code>egg-herbie</code> is much faster, but uses
    compiled binaries that cannot be installed on some systems. Herbie
    will then fall back to <code>regraph</code>, and get similar
    results but run roughly twice as long.
    Install <code>egg-herbie</code> with <code>raco</code>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="unsound-rules">Unsound rule application detected</h3>
  
  <p>
    Herbie uses a set of algebraic rewrite rules in order to simplify expressions, but these
    rules can sometimes lead to a contradiction.
    Herbie will automatically compensate for this, and in most cases nothing needs to be done.
    However, Herbie may have failed to simplify the output.
  </p>


  <h2>Known bugs</h2>

  <p>Bugs that cannot be directly fixed are documented in this section.</p>

  <h3>Missing reports chart on Chrome</h3>

  <p>
    When using Chrome to view web pages on your local machine, Herbie
    reports cannot draw the arrow chart due to security restrictions.
    <a href="http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/">Run
    Chrome with <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code></a> to fix
    this error.
