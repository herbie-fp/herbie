  <p>The <a href="../../"><code>herbie</code></a> command has
  subcommands and options that influence both its user interface and
  the quality of its output.</p>

  <h2>Herbie commands</h2>

  <p>Herbie can be run both interactively and in batch mode, and can
  generate output intended either for
  the <a href="using-cli.html">command line</a>
  or <a href="using-web.html">the web</a>. We call these different
  ways of running Herbie different tools. Herbie provides four
  tools:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>herbie web</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie <a href="using-web.html">through your browser</a>.
    The <code>herbie web</code> command runs Herbie on your local
    machine and opens your browser to its main page.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie shell</code></dt>
    <dd>Use Herbie <a href="using-cli.html">via a command-line shell</a>.
    Enter an <a href="input.html">FPCore expression</a> and Herbie
    will print its more-accurate version.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie improve <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Run Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>. The results are written
    to <var>output</var>, a single file in FPCore format.</dd>

    <dt><code>herbie report <var>input</var> <var>output</var></code></dt>
    <dd>Run Herbie on the expressions in the file or
    directory <var>input</var>. The results are written
    to <var>output</var>, a directory of
    HTML <a href="report.html">reports</a>. These pages can be viewed
    in any browser (though with a <a href="faq.html">quirk</a> for
    Chrome).</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>We recommend using <code>web</code> and <code>report</code>,
  which produce <a href="report.html">reports</a> with lots of
  information about floating-point accuracy, including graphs it of
  error versus input values. This can help you understand whether
  Herbie's improvements matter for your use case.</p>

  <p>Use <code>herbie <var>tool</var> --help</code> to available
  command-line options for a tool. This command also shows unsupported
  options not listed on this page.</p>

  <h2>General options</h2>

  <p>
    These options can be set on any tool. Pass them after the tool
    name but before other arguments, like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="shell">herbie report --timeout 60 in.fpcore out/</pre>

  <p>Arguments cannot go before options.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--seed S</code></dt>
    <dd>The random seed, which changes the randomly-selected points
      that Herbie evaluates candidate expressions on. The seed is a
      number between 0 and 2<sup>31</sup> (exclusive both ends). This
      option can be used to make Herbie's results reproducible or to
      compare two different runs. Seeds are not preserved across
      runs.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-points N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of input points Herbie uses to evaluate candidate
      expressions. The default, 256, is a good balance for most
      programs. Increasing this option, say to 512 or 1024, will slow
      Herbie down but may make its results more consistent.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-iters N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of times Herbie attempts to improve accuracy. The
      default, 4, suffices for most programs and helps keep Herbie
      fast; in practice iterations beyond the first few rarely lead to
      lower error. Increase this option, say to 6, to check that there
      aren't further improvements that Herbie could seek out.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-analysis N</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of input subdivisions to use when searching for
      valid input points. The default is 14. Increasing this option
      will slow Herbie down, but may fix the
      "<a href="faq.html#sample-valid-points">Cannot sample enough
      valid points</a>" error.
    </dd>
    
    <dt><code>--timeout T</code></dt>
    <dd>The timeout to use per-input, in seconds. A fractional number
      of seconds can be given.</dd>

    <dt><code>--threads N</code> (for the <code>improve</code> and <code>report</code> tools)</dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-threaded operation. By default, no threads are
      used. A number can be passed to this option to use that many
      threads, or <code>yes</code> can be passed to tell Herbie to use
      all of the hardware threads.</dd>

    <dt><code>--pareto</code></dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-objective improvement. Herbie will attempt to simultaneously
    optimize for both accuracy and expression cost. Rather than generating
    a single "ideal" output expression, Herbie will generate many output expressions.
    This mode is still considered experimental. This <em>will</em> take a long time to run.
    We recommend timeouts measured in hours.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Web shell options</h2>
  
  <p>The <code>web</code> tool runs Herbie and connects to it from
  your browser. It has options to control the underlying web
  server.</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><code>--port N</code></dt>
    <dd>The port the Herbie server runs on. The default port is 8000.</dd>

    <dt><code>--save-session dir</code></dt>
    <dd>Save all the reports to this directory. The directory also
    caches previously-computed expressions.</dd>

    <dt><code>--log file</code></dt>
    <dd>Write an access log to this file, formatted like an Apache
    log. This log does <em>not</em> contain crash tracebacks.</dd>

    <dt><code>--quiet</code></dt>
    <dd>By default, but not when this option is set, a browser is
    automatically started to show the Herbie page. This option also
    shrinks the text printed on start up.</dd>

    <dt><code>--public</code></dt>
    <dd>When set, users on other computers can connect to the demo and
    use it. (In other words, the server listens
    on <code>0.0.0.0</code>.). Essential when Herbie is run
    from <a href="docker.html">Docker</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Rulesets</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie uses rewrite rules to change programs and improve accuracy.
    The <code>--disable rules:<var>group</var></code>
    and <code>--enable rules:<var>group</var></code> options turn rule
    sets on and off. In general, turning a ruleset on makes Herbie
    produce more accurate but more confusing programs.
  </p>

  <p>The full list of rule groups is:</p>

  <table class="function-list">
    <thead><tr><th>Rule Group</th><th>Topic of rewrite rules</th></tr></thead>
    <tr><td>arithmetic</td><td>Basic arithmetic facts</td></tr>
    <tr><td>polynomials</td><td>Factoring and powers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>fractions</td><td>Fraction arithmetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>exponents</td><td>Exponentiation identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>trigonometry</td><td>Trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>hyperbolic</td><td>Hyperbolic trigonometric identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bools</td><td>Boolean operator identities</td></tr>
    <tr><td>branches</td><td><code>if</code> statement simplification</td></tr>
    <tr><td>special</td><td>The gamma, Bessel, and error functions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>numerics</td><td>Numerical compounds <code>expm1</code>, <code>log1p</code>, <code>fma</code>, and <code>hypot</code></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>All groups except <code>numerics</code> are enabled by default.
  We recommend turning <code>numerics</code> on if these functions are
  available in your language.</p>

  <h2>Search options</h2>

  <p>
    These options change the types of transformations that Herbie uses
    to find candidate programs. We recommend sticking to the defaults.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each option can be turned off with the <code>-o</code>
    or <code>--disable</code> command-line flag and on with
    <code>+o</code> or <code>--enable</code>. Turning an option off
    typically results in less-accurate results, while turning a option
    on typically results in more confusing output expressions.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>precision:fallback</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, tells Herbie to use fallback
    functions if a native implementation is not found for an operation
    (and print a warning). If turned off, operations with no native
    implementation will be disabled entirely. To our knowledge, this
    option only affects the Bessel functions on Windows.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies the expression before
    passing it to Herbie. If turned off, Herbie will not simplify
    input programs before improving them.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:rr</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's recursive rewriting
    algorithm to generate candidate programs. If turned off, Herbie
    will use a non-recursive rewriting algorithm, which will
    substantially limit Herbie's creativity.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses series expansion to produce
    new candidates during the main improvement loop. If turned off,
    Herbie will not use series expansion. Turn this option off if you
    want to avoid series-expansion-based rewrites, such as if you need
    to preserve the equivalence of the input and output expressions as
    real-number formulas.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies candidates during the
    main improvement loop. If turned off, candidates will not be
    simplified, which typically results in much less accurate
    expressions.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:regimes</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's regime inference
    algorithm to branch between several program candidates. If turned
    off, branches will not be inferred and the output program will be
    straight-line code (if the input was). Turn this option off if
    your programming environment makes branches very expensive, such
    as on a GPU.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:avg-error</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, causes Herbie to output the
    candidate with the best average error over the chosen inputs. If
    turned off, Herbie will choose the candidate with the least
    maximum error instead. This usually produces programs with worse
    overall accuracy. Turn this option off if worst-case accuracy is
    more important to you than overall accuracy.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:binary-search</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses binary search to refine the
    values used in inferred branches. If turned off, different runs of
    Herbie will be less consistent, and accuracy near branches will
    suffer.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:branch-expressions</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, allows Herbie to branch on
      expressions, not just variables. This slows Herbie down,
      particularly for large programs. If turned off, Herbie will only
      try to branch on variables.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Upgrading from Herbie 1.0</h2>

  <p>Herbie 1.0 used
  a <a href="../1.0/using-herbie.html">different</a> command line
  syntax, without multiple tools. Translate like so:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0</code> → <code>herbie-1.4 shell</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 file</code> → <code>herbie-1.4 improve file -</code></li>
    <li><code>herbie-1.0 files ...</code> → <code>cat files ... | herbie-1.4 improve - -</code><br/>
      Alternatively, collect the files into a directory and run <code>herbie-1.4 improve dir/ -</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The new syntax somewhat changes Herbie's behavior, such as by
  using the input expression as the output if Herbie times out. It
  also makes it easier to write Herbie's output to a file without
  using command-line redirection.</p>
