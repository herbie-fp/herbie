<h2>PLDI’15: Herbie <span class="badges">★ 🏆</span></h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <a href="pldi15-paper.pdf">Automatically Improving Accuracy for Floating Point Expressions</a>
    was published at
    <a href="http://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi2015">★&nbsp;PLDI 2015</a>,
    where it won the 🏆&nbsp;<em>Distinguished Paper Award</em>.
    The paper introduces Herbie, describes its internals, and
    relates experiments describing its effectiveness.
  </summary>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Scientific and engineering applications depend on floating
    point arithmetic to approximate real arithmetic. This
    approximation introduces rounding error, which can accumulate to
    produce unacceptable results. While the numerical methods
    literature provides techniques to mitigate rounding error,
    applying these techniques requires manually rearranging
    expressions and understanding the finer details of floating point
    arithmetic.</p>
    <p>We introduce Herbie, a tool which <em>automatically</em>
    discovers the rewrites experts perform to improve accuracy.
    Herbie's heuristic search estimates and localizes rounding error
    using sampled points (rather than static error analysis), applies
    a database of rules to generate improvements, takes series
    expansions, and combines improvements for different input regions.
    We evaluated Herbie on examples from a classic numerical methods
    textbook, and found that Herbie was able to improve accuracy on
    each example, some by up to 60 bits, while imposing a median
    performance overhead of 40%. Colleagues in machine learning have
    used Herbie to significantly improve the results of a clustering
    algorithm, and a mathematical library has accepted two patches
    generated using Herbie.</p>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>We introduce FPBench, a standard benchmark format for

    floating-point computations. FPBench is a first step toward
    addressing an increasing need in our community for comparisons and
    combinations of tools from different application domains. To this
    end, FPBench provides a basic floating-point benchmark format and
    accuracy measures for comparing different tools. The FPBench
    format and measures allow comparing and composing different
    floating-point tools. We describe the FPBench format and measures
    and show that FPBench expresses benchmarks from recent papers in
    the literature, by building an initial benchmark suite drawn from
    these papers. We intend for FPBench to grow into a standard

    2018</a>. The paper describes how Herbgrind tracks error and
    discovers root causes for floating-point error.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Floating-point arithmetic plays a central role in science,
    engineering, and finance by enabling developers to approximate
    real arithmetic. To address numerical issues in large
    floating-point applications, developers must identify root causes,
    which is difficult because floating-point errors are generally
    non-local, non-compositional, and non-uniform.</p>
    <p>This paper presents Herbgrind, a tool to help developers
    identify and address root causes in numerical code written in
    low-level languages like C/C++ and Fortran. Herbgrind dynamically
    tracks dependencies between operations and program outputs to
    avoid false positives and abstracts erroneous computations to
    simplified program fragments whose improvement can reduce output
    error. We perform several case studies applying Herbgrind to
    large, expert-crafted numerical programs and show that it scales
    to applications spanning hundreds of thousands of lines, correctly
    handling the low-level details of modern floating point hardware
    and mathematical libraries and tracking error across function
    boundaries and through the heap.</p>

<h2>FM’18 short: Daisy/Herbie</h2>

    at <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/FM2018/">FM'18'</a>. The
    paper describes how different floating-point analysis tools can be
    combined using tools provided by the FPBench project.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Recent renewed interest in optimizing and analyzing
    floating-point programs has lead to a diverse array of new tools
    for numerical programs. These tools are often complementary, each
    focusing on a distinct aspect of numerical programming. Building
    reliable floating point applications typically requires addressing
    several of these aspects, which makes easy composition essential.
    This paper describes the composition of two recent floating-point
    tools: Herbie, which performs accuracy optimization, and Daisy,
    which performs accuracy verification. We find that the combination
    provides numerous benefits to users, such as being able to use
    Daisy to check whether Herbie's unsound optimizations improved the
    worst-case roundoff error, as well as benefits to tool authors,
    including uncovering a number of bugs in both tools. The
    combination also allowed us to compare the different program
    rewriting techniques implemented by these tools for the first

    code.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Recent research has provided new, domain-specific number
    systems that accelerate modern workloads. Using these number
    systems effectively requires analyzing subtle multi-format,
    multi-precision (MPMF) code. Ideally, recent programming tools
    that automate numerical analysis tasks could help make MPMF
    programs both accurate and fast. However, three key challenges
    must be addressed: existing automated tools are difficult to
    compose due to subtle incompatibilities; there is no "gold
    standard" for correct MPMF execution; and no methodology exists
    for generalizing existing, IEEE-754-specialized tools to support
    MPMF. In this paper we report on recent work towards mitigating
    these related challenges. First, we extend the FPBench standard to
    support multi-precision, multi-format (MPMF) applications. Second,
    we present Titanic, a tool which provides reference results for
    arbitrary MPMF computations. Third, we describe our experience

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>The last few years have seen an explosion of work on tools that address numerical error in scientific, mathematical, and engineering software.

It is now time for these tools to move into practice.</p>
    <p>Practitioners need a "numerical workbench" that not only succeeds as a research artifact but as a daily tool. We describe our experience adapting Herbie, a tool for numerical error repair, from a research prototype to a reliable workhorse for daily use. In particular, we focus on how we worked to increase user trust and use internal measurement to polish the tool. Looking more broadly, we show that community development and an investment in the generality of our tools, such as through the FPBench project, will better support users and strengthen our research community.</p>

    Fast and extensible equality saturation</a> was published at
    <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2021">★&nbsp;PLDI 2021</a>,
    where it won the 🏆&nbsp;<em>Distinguished Paper Award</em>.
    The paper describes a new library for equality saturation used by Herbie.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over
    many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the
    late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent
    technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to
    implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations
    and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized
    for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit
    distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph
    extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic
    rewrites.</p>
    <p>This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast
    and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new
    amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes
    advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing
    asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general
    mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific
    analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc
    manipulation.</p>
    <p>We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library
    called egg. Our case studies on three previously published
    applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's
    performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across
    diverse domains.</p>

<h2>ArXiv’21: Rival</h2>

    Arithmetic for Robust Error Estimation</a> is an unpublished
    manuscript. This paper describes Herbie's interval arithmetic
    library.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Interval arithmetic is a simple way to compute a mathematical expression to an arbitrary accuracy, widely used for verifying floating-point computations. Yet this simplicity belies challenges. Some inputs violate preconditions or cause domain errors. Others cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop and fail to compute a ground truth. Plus, finding valid inputs is itself a challenge when invalid and unsamplable points make up the vast majority of the input space. These issues can make interval arithmetic brittle and temperamental.</p>
    <p>This paper introduces three extensions to interval arithmetic to address these challenges. Error intervals express rich notions of input validity and indicate whether all or some points in an interval violate implicit or explicit preconditions. Movability flags detect futile recomputations and prevent timeouts by indicating whether a higher-precision recomputation will yield a more accurate result. Andinput search restricts sampling to valid, samplable points, so they are easier to find. We compare these extensions to the state-of-the-art technical computing software Mathematica, and demonstrate that our extensions are able to resolve 60.3% more challenging inputs, return 10.2x fewer completely indeterminate results, and avoid 64 cases of fatal error.</p>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Precision tuning and rewriting can improve both the accuracy
      and speed of floating point expressions, yet these techniques are
      typically applied separately. This paper explores how
      finer-grained interleaving of precision tuning and rewriting can

<h2>OOPSLA’21: Ruler <span class="badges">★ 🏆</span></h2>

    where it won the 🏆&nbsp;<em>Distinguished Paper Award</em>. The
    paper describes how rewrite rules, like the ones Herbie uses, can
    be synthesized from examples.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Many compilers, synthesizers, and theorem provers rely on rewrite rules to simplify expressions or prove equivalences. Developing rewrite rules can be difficult: rules may be subtly incorrect, profitable rules are easy to miss, and rulesets must be rechecked or extended whenever semantics are tweaked. Large rulesets can also be challenging to apply: redundant rules slow down rule-based search and frustrate debugging.</p>
    <p>This paper explores how equality saturation, a promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules, can also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent the exponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite rules. We show that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets, leading to faster synthesis of smaller, more general rulesets.</p>
    <p>We prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed Ruler. Compared to a similar tool built on CVC4, Ruler synthesizes 5.8× smaller rulesets 25× faster without compromising on proving power. In an end-to-end case study, we show Ruler-synthesized rules which perform as well as those crafted by domain experts, and addressed a longstanding issue in a popular open source tool.</p>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Identities compactly describe properties of a mathematical

    a two-phase synthesis and deduplication pipeline that discovers
    these identities automatically. In the synthesis step, a set of
    rewrite rules is composed, using an e-graph, to discover candidate
    identities. However, most of these candidates are duplicates,
    which a secondary de-duplication step discards using integer
    linear programming and another e-graph. Applied to a set of 61

<h2>PLDI’22: OpTuner <span class="badges">★</span></h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>Choosing Mathematical Function Implementations for Speed and Accuracy</em>
    was published
    at <a href="https://pldi22.sigplan.org/">PLDI'22</a>. The paper
    describes how multiple implementations of functions
    like <code>sin</code> can be combined to achieve better
    combinations of accuracy and precision.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Standard implementations of functions like <code>sin</code>
    and <code>exp</code> optimize for accuracy, not speed, because
    they are intended for general-purpose use. But just like many
    applications tolerate inaccuracy from cancellation, rounding
    error, and singularities, many application could also tolerate
    less-accurate function implementations. This raises an intriguing
    possibility: speeding up numerical code by using different
    function implementations.</p>
    <p>This paper thus introduces OpTuner, an automated tool for
    selecting the best implementation for each mathematical function
    call site. OpTuner uses error Taylor series and integer linear
    programming to compute optimal assignments of 297 function
    implementations to call sites and presents the user with a
    speed-accuracy Pareto curve. In a case study on the POV-Ray ray
    tracer, OpTuner speeds up a critical computation by 2.48×, leading
    to a whole program speedup of 1.09× with no change in the program
    output; human efforts result in slower code and lower-quality
    output. On a broader study of 36 standard benchmarks, OpTuner
    demonstrates speedups of 2.05× for negligible decreases in
    accuracy and of up to 5.37× for error-tolerant applications.</p>

    tool.
  </summary>
  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers and equality
    saturation engines must generate proof certificates from
    e-graph-based congruence closure procedures to enable verification
    and conflict clause generation. Smaller proof certificates speed
    up these activities. Though the problem of generating proofs of
    minimal size is known to be NP-complete, existing proof
    minimization algorithms for congruence closure generate
    unnecessarily large proofs and introduce asymptotic overhead over
    the core congruence closure procedure. In this paper, we introduce
    an <code>O(n<sup>5</sup>)</code> time algorithm which generates
    optimal proofs under a new relaxed “proof tree size” metric that
    directly bounds proof size. We then relax this approach further to
    a practical <code>O(n log(n))</code> greedy algorithm which
    generates small proofs with no asymptotic overhead. We implemented
    our techniques in the egg equality saturation toolkit, yielding
    the first certifying equality saturation engine. We show that our
    greedy approach in egg quickly generates substantially smaller
    proofs than the state-of-the-art Z3 SMT solver on a corpus of
