  <p>
    The <a href="index.html">Herbie</a> command takes several options
    that influence its search procedure and the types of solutions it finds.
    These options apply both to the report generator and the one-off command-line tool.
  </p>

  <h2>General Options</h2>

  These options can be set on both the report generator and the one-off tool,
  and influence the coarse properties of Herbie's search.

  <dl>
    <dt><code>-r</code> or <code>--seed</code></dt>
    <dd>This sets the random seed, which changes the randomly-selected
      points that Herbie evaluates candidate expressions on. The
      format of the seed is that used by the
      Racket <code>vector->pseudo-random-generator!</code> function;
      in practice, just use a seed produced by an earlier run. This
      option can be used to make Herbie's results reproducible or to
      compare two different runs.</dd>

    <dt><code>--fuel</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of improvements Herbie attempts to make to the
      program. The default, 2, suffices for most programs and helps
      keep Herbie fast. If this is set very high, Herbie may run out
      of things to do and terminate before the given number of
      iterations, but in practice iterations beyond the first few
      rarely lead to lower error. This option can be increased to 3 or
      4 to check that there aren't further improvements that Herbie
      could eek out.</dd>

    <dt><code>--num-points</code></dt>
    <dd>The number of randomly-selected points used to evaluate
      candidate expressions. The default, 256, gives good behavior for
      most programs. The more points sampled, the slower Herbie is.
      This option can be increased to 512 or 1024 if Herbie gives very
      inconsistent results between runs with different seeds.</dd>

    <dt><code>--threads</code>, for the report generator only</dt>
    <dd>Enables multi-threaded operation. By default, no threads are
      used, a number can be passed to this option to use that many
      threads, or <code>yes</code> can be passed to tell Herbie to use
      all but one of the hardware threads. This option is not
      supported on OS X or in Racket 6.2, and will warn if used in
      those cases.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Search Options</h2>

  These options influence the fine properties of Herbie's search, most
  importantly the types of transformations that Herbie uses to find
  candidate programs. These options offer very fine-grained control
  over Herbie's output, and are only recommended for advanced uses of
  Herbie.

  Each option can be toggled with the <code>-o</code>
  or <code>--option</code> command-line flags. The recommended set of
  options is the default set; turning a default-on option off
  typically results in less-accurate results, while turning a
  default-off option on typically results in more-complex and
  more-surprising output expressions.

  <dl>
    <dt><code>precision:double</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, runs Herbie in double-precision
      mode. If turned off, Herbie runs in single-precision mode.</dd>

    <dt><code>setup:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies the expression before
      passing it to Herbie. If turned off, Herbie will not simplify
      input programs before improving them. You will want to turn off
      this option if simplifying the program will create a lot of
      error, say if the association of operations is cleverly
      chosen.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:rr</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's recursive rewriting
      algorithm to generate candidate programs. If turned off, Herbie
      will use a non-recursive rewriting algorithm, which will
      substantially limit the candidates Herbie finds. You will rarely
      want to turn this option off.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses series expansion to produce
      new candidates during the main improvement loop. If turned off,
      Herbie will not use series expansion in the main improvement loop.
      You will want to turn this option off if you want to avoid
      series-expansion-based rewrites, such as if you need to preserve
      the equivalence of the input and output expressions as real-number
      formulas.</dd>

    <dt><code>generate:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, simplifies candidates during the
      main improvement loop. If turned off, candidates will not be
      simplified, which typically results in much less accurate
      expressions, since simplification is often necessary for
      cancelling terms. You will rarely want to turn this option off.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:regimes</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses Herbie's regime inference
      algorithm to branch between several program candidates. If
      turned off, brances will be inferred and the output program will
      be straight-line code (if the input was). You will want to turn
      this option off if your programming environment makes branches
      too expensive, such as in some cases of GPU programming.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:taylor</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses a final set of series
      expansions after all improvements have been made. This sometimes
      improves accuracy further. If turned off, this final series
      expansion pass will not be done. You will want to turn this
      option off if you want to avoid series-expansion-based rewrites,
      such as if you need to preserve the equivalence of the input and
      output expressions as real-number formulas.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:simplify</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, uses a final simplification pass
      after all improvements have been made. This sometimes improves
      accuracy further. If turned off, this final simplification pass
      will not be done. You will rarely want to turn this option
      off.</dd>

    <dt><code>reduce:avg-error</code></dt>
    <dd>This option, on by default, causes Herbie to output the
      candidate with the best average error over the chosen inputs. If
      turned off, Herbie will choose the candidate by maximum error
      instead. This usually produces programs with worse overall
      accuracy. You may want to turn this option on if worst-case
      accuracy is more important to you than overall accuracy.</dd>
