  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>Precision tuning and rewriting can improve both the accuracy
    and speed of floating point expressions, yet these techniques are
    typically applied separately. This paper explores how
    finer-grained interleaving of precision tuning and rewriting can
    help automatically generate a richer set of Pareto-optimal
    accuracy versus speed trade-offs.</p>
    <p>We introduce Pherbie (Pareto Herbie), a tool providing both
    precision tuning and rewriting, % (using algebraic identities and
    series expansions), and evaluate interleaving these two strategies
    at different granularities. Our results demonstrate that
    finer-grained interleavings improve both the Pareto curve of
    candidate implementations and overall optimization time. On a
    popular set of tests from the FPBench suite, Pherbie finds both
    implementations that are significantly more accurate for a given
    cost and significantly faster for a given accuracy bound compared
    to baselines using precision tuning and rewriting alone or in
    sequence.</p>

    The paper describes the modifications we made to Herbie to support multiple precisions and even multiple number systems (like fixed-point or posits), how we modified Herbie's internals to optimize for both cost and accuracy, and shows
