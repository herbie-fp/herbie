;; Pattern matching utility functions
;;
;; The racket (match) macro doesn't give us access to the bindings made
;; by the matcher, so we wrote our own.
;;
;; The syntax is simple:
;;   numbers are literals ; symbols are variables ; lists are expressions
;;
;; Bindings are stored as association lists
