You are tasked with generating new benchmarks for Herbie, a numerical compiler that rewrites floating-point expressions to reduce error. 

When you receive a new source file:

1. **Skim for numerically fragile code paths.** Focus on
   - Branches guarding against domain violations (division by zero, `fabs` comparisons, overflow checks).
   - Expressions wrapped in conditionals, iterative refinements, or polynomial corrections applied only to small ranges.
   - Sequences of transcendental functions (`exp`, `asinh`, `atan2`, etc.) composed together.

2. **Score candidate expressions.** Prefer ones that are
   - Prone to catastrophic cancellation (differences of comparably sized terms, exponentials combined with reciprocals).
   - Already noted as “exact”, “correction”, or “series expansion” code by the source comments.

3. **Isolate the expression.** For each expression:
   - Identify the minimal set of variables needed (pull intermediate definitions when helpful).
   - Convert to FPCore using lisp syntax.
   - Add a `:pre` condition mirroring the guards in the source so Herbie’s sampler stays inside the intended domain.
   - Preserve structure instead of using algebraic simplifications.

4. **Validate syntax.** Run

   ```
   racket -y src/main.rkt report --platform no-accelerators <FPCORE FILE> out
   ```

   Fix any syntax errors Herbie reports (missing parentheses, unsupported identifiers, missing preconditions). Rerun until the file parses cleanly. Warnings about improvement quality are fine; only syntax errors must be resolved.

Aim for a set of 15–20 expressions that represent the numerical behaviors from the source file. Ideally, this collection will include  hard expressions that Herbie has trouble improving.
